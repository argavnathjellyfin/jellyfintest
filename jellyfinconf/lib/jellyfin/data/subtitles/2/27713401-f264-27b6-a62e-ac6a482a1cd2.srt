1
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,750
Nazeem Khan, you made a statement
at a party in London

2
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,167
that you're not married
but you do have kids.

3
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,083
-That means you're in a live-in.
-You've disgraced the institution

4
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,750
of marriage and Indian culture!

5
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,417
What are you guys saying?

6
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,875
I celebrate festivals like Eid
and Diwali.

7
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,792
After doing marriage oriented movies

8
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,667
how can you say such things
about marriage?

9
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,167
Says who? Who said I abused?

10
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,708
You need a controversy, right?
You'll never get it.

11
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,000
Is this a publicity stunt for a movie?

12
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,625
And even your late night parties
are always in news.

13
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,333
It's my life.

14
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,833
I can do whatever I want.

15
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,708
Whether I party till late in the night
or have a live-in...

16
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,417
how does it matter to you?

17
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,083
Live-in, huh...

18
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,167
So you being termed
as anti-national is right.

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,583
Tell us. Please tell us.

20
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,958
He's gone.

21
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,917
-Nazeem Khan.
-Down-Down.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,833
-Nazeem Khan.
-Down-Down.

23
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,042
-Glory to...
-Culture Protection Party.

24
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,708
<i>Radhe-Radhe!</i>

25
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,417
<i>There are quite a few similarities</i>
<i>between a politician and an actor.</i>

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,375
<i>They are both drama queens...</i>

27
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,667
<i>and they both want publicity.</i>

28
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,083
<i>And lots of it.</i>

29
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,708
<i>No one knows what Nazeem Khan said</i>

30
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:19,083
<i>but it certainly deemed</i>
<i>love a sin in UP and MP.</i>

31
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:24,958
<i>Suddenly live-in relationships</i>
<i>had become a national issue.</i>

32
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>Nazeem Khan's movie posters</i>
<i>were torn down...</i>

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>Lovebirds faced the brunt of it too.</i>

34
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,625
<i>Because according to</i>
<i>the Culture Protection Party...</i>

35
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,250
<i>any kind of a pre-marital relation</i>

36
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,542
<i>is against Indian culture.</i>

37
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,042
<i>They have their own set of rules.</i>

38
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,250
<i>And in case you don't like their rules...</i>

39
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>you are free to raise your voice.</i>

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,417
<i>Feel free to raise your voice.</i>

41
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>It won't change anything but</i>
<i>you may end up having a sore throat.</i>

42
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:55,958
<i>With cameraman Abbas Shaikh,</i>
<i>I am Guddu Shukla for Mathura Live.</i>

43
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,833
<i>-Nazeem Khan.</i>
<i>-Down-Down.</i>

44
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,083
<i>Beat him!</i>

45
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,375
HIDE AND SEEK

46
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,958
<i>The protest over Nazeem Khan's statement</i>

47
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:08,375
<i>has taken a violent turn</i>
<i>in many parts of North India.</i>

48
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,083
<i>You can see how the workers</i>
<i>of Culture Protection Party</i>

49
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,333
<i>are apprehending young lovers</i>

50
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,000
<i>and blackening their faces.</i>

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,250
<i>As a result colleges remained closed</i>
<i>in various parts of the city.</i>

52
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,542
<i>But the biggest question</i>
<i>that still lingers is...</i>

53
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,875
<i>"Is this really</i>
<i>a question of culture</i>

54
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,333
<i>or just a PR stunt</i>
<i>for the upcoming elections?"</i>

55
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,958
<i>We'll find out after the break</i>

56
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,167
<i>from Culture Protection party's ex-MP</i>
<i>from Mathura, Vishnu Trivedi--</i>

57
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,125
Guddu, I spoke to the people
from Diamond News in Delhi.

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,917
They want us to do another job
before the Gwalior Elections.

59
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,958
They want us to prepare a report

60
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:47,500
on opinions of different people
on marriage and live-in relationship.

61
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:51,417
They will telecast it
as an interesting feature.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,583
We're ready, sir.
Just tell us when to begin.

63
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,875
-Hello, Mr. Trivedi.
-Come, Uncle.

64
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,792
Come sit. Come, Rashmi.

65
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,208
-Mr. Pandey.
-Hello, sir.

66
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,625
-How are you?
-All is well.

67
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,917
It's okay...

68
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,125
Come, sit. Get some tea.

69
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,167
What can I order for you, Mr. Trivedi?

70
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,042
There's no need for this formality.

71
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,667
Tell me how's your channel doing.

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,917
Well, thanks to you, it's doing good.

73
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,167
How's your political party doing?

74
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,917
The Culture Protection Party.

75
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,458
Well, it's doing better than ever.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I owe it to these traitors...

77
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:28,458
who disrespect
our country, our culture and religion.

78
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,375
We're protesting against Nazeem Khan.

79
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,167
We won't let any of
his movies to be released in UP.

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,083
If we spot his picture at any salon

81
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,333
we'll burn it down to ashes.

82
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:40,042
The picture, the shop
and even the cars parked outside the shop.

83
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,875
-Long live revolution--
-Okay...

84
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,917
Mr. Pandey, she's my daughter Rashmi.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,958
Hello.

86
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,917
-I told you about her over the phone.
-Yes...

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She returned from Delhi a week ago...

88
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,292
after getting a degree in Media studies.

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,667
She also did her schooling there.

90
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,958
My younger brother lives there.

91
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,792
Uncle runs a transport
business in Gurgaon.

92
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,375
He owns 72 trucks. How many?

93
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,542
Seventy-two...

94
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,583
And none of his trucks
ever stops at the toll...

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
Rashmi was saying that
she wants to go back to Delhi...

96
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,375
to work as an assistant in a TV channel.

97
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,625
That's internship, Father.

98
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,917
Exactly.

99
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,417
But I said my friend Pandey
owns a channel.

100
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,917
It's right here in Mathura,
you can do your internship here.

101
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,375
This way she can stay
with us for a few more days.

102
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,083
-Mr. Trivedi, this is your company.
-See...

103
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,042
-Rashmi.
-Yes.

104
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,083
I must tell you one thing
before you start working.

105
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,833
We're not a big news channel.
We run a cable-news channel.

106
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,125
And also do some freelance work
for the news channels in Delhi.

107
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,875
I don't have a problem.

108
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,458
And anyway, it's just for a month.

109
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,958
I am not planning on staying here forever.

110
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,958
So this way I'll get to
know the local news network...

111
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,500
and I can put this on my CV as well. So...

112
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,458
Fine. You can join us tomorrow.

113
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,333
We were just discussing a report.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,375
You can join in if you want.

115
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,542
-Yes, of course.
-Great.

116
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,667
Let me introduce you to our team.

117
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,292
This is Guddu Shukla, our star reporter.

118
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:09,417
Only a fool wouldn't know him.
He's the face of your channel.

119
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,292
A one-take artiste.

120
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,292
I've seen you reporting on TV.

121
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,958
Your style's quite different.

122
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,833
Thank you.

123
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,375
Elections are around the corner.

124
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,583
And I am contesting
the parliamentary elections again.

125
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,958
I'll give you a couple
of interviews as well.

126
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,292
Uncle...

127
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,208
Interview him too.

128
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,750
And that's our cameraman.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,292
-Yes.
-Abbas.

130
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,958
<i>-Radhe-Radhe!</i>
<i>-Walekumsalam.</i>

131
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,917
<i>Radhe-Radhe!</i>

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,500
So we're with the sage from KC Ghat.

133
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,000
So, sir, this new issue on
the block about live-in relationships...

134
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,167
where the boy and girl live
together without getting married...

135
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,208
what is your opinion on it?

136
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,583
Look, son, ever since I was born...

137
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,125
I've only worshipped Radha-Krishna.

138
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,708
From whatever knowledge of the scriptures
I possess, I can tell you

139
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,583
that they were not married either.

140
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,375
And there is no better love story
in this world, than theirs.

141
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,500
So you mean to say that live-in
relationships are not wrong.

142
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,083
As long as there is love,
everything's chaste, dear.

143
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:36,833
Without love, it's wrong to
look at anyone with such intentions.

144
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,167
"All the books in the world won't
show you the path to enlightenment.

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,042
But those who experience love,
get enlightened."

146
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,083
I have a question, Guddu.

147
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,792
If Shah Jahan had a live-in
relationship with Mumtaz...

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,417
would he have built the Taj Mahal?

149
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,167
Taj Mahal is not the symbol
of Shah Jahan's wedding...

150
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,167
it's the symbol of his love.

151
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,708
Don't you have any better things to do?

152
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,875
Why are you bothering me
for this nonsense!

153
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,292
Where the hell have you come from?
You...

154
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,708
Live-in is a good thing.

155
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,625
I was in a live-in
for eight years in Delhi.

156
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,708
But there are other issues
in the country that you can cover.

157
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,417
Many issues. So cover them.

158
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,458
This is a stupid issue.

159
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,083
-You're in a live-in?
-What's wrong?

160
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,750
-You're in a live-in?
-Leave my hand.

161
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,208
But is live-in our culture?

162
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,917
Live-in is just an excuse for sex.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Just find me a girl
and I'll take care of the rest.

164
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,208
Right?

165
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,250
Living with a girl without marrying her?

166
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,292
I hadn't seen my wife's face
before marrying her.

167
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,500
I just did what my father said.

168
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,333
And now I am the father of three.

169
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,833
I wasn't floored
by your handsome face either.

170
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,708
All thanks to your government job
and your father.

171
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,625
Otherwise
you would've still been a bachelor.

172
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,625
God save us from such a wife.

173
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,667
She is very dangerous.

174
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,958
Hello, ma'am. We're from TV news.

175
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,583
Why are you yelling?

176
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,125
I am old, not deaf.

177
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,250
We wanted to ask you some questions.

178
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,500
Go ahead and ask whatever you want to.

179
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,417
-Would you like to ask her instead?
-What?

180
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,583
Would you?

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,250
-Okay.
-I see...

182
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,500
She is going to ask her.

183
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,708
-All the best.
-Thank you.

184
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,375
Am I looking fine?

185
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
Wait a second. This profile is better.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,125
-Looking better from this side.
-Ma'am, right?

187
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,625
-Ready, Rashmi? Camera rolling.
-Yes.

188
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,000
Grandma, a new system has taken
the country by storm these days...

189
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,125
where the boy and girl
live together before getting married...

190
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,792
in order to know each other.

191
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,292
In the same house.

192
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,583
So what is your opinion on it?

193
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,792
That's a really nice system, dear.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,625
If, before my marriage, I had any idea
that my husband was a drunkard...

195
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,083
I would never have married him.

196
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,292
The rascal died in his youth.

197
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,750
he left me with neither children
nor respect.

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,667
-Thank you.
-Listen...

199
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,833
Take my advice.

200
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,583
Don't ever marry a guy until
you know him well.

201
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,708
-Rashmi, let's go.
-No, I won't.

202
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,917
Yes, she won't.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,958
-Leave her.
-Yes, ma'am.

204
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,167
-Don't you forget that.
-Sure.

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,583
-Rashmi, let's go.
-I won't.

206
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,917
Very good, ma'am.

207
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,458
-Everybody says "She rocks".
-She rocks!

208
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,500
Ma'am, bye!

209
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,833
By the way, Guddu...

210
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,042
what is your opinion on
live-in relationships and marriage?

211
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,750
My opinion?

212
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,875
Even I feel that if there's love,
everything is chaste.

213
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,542
But if there's true love,
why hesitate to get married?

214
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:00,583
If tying a knot gives the respect
to your relationship in the society

215
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,333
then isn't it better to get married?

216
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,875
-Are you married?
-No.

217
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,500
-Any girlfriend?
-None.

218
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,417
Okay.

219
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,708
-Why?
-Just a casual question?

220
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,542
-Do you have a BF?
-BF?

221
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:19,958
Not anymore.

222
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,167
So you did have one?

223
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,875
Just a casual question.

224
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,292
I did, back in college.

225
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,333
-And then?
-Then what? I shot back to reality.

226
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,042
Meaning?

227
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,458
I mean people act so stupid
when they're in love.

228
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,750
They don't see what they should.

229
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,667
Sometimes they get impressed
by someone's branded clothes...

230
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,333
and sometimes by the perfume they wear.

231
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,375
And you face reality
when the perfume fades.

232
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,417
-So you're single.
-What?

233
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,667
I mean... I don't need a perfume at all.

234
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,792
I smell good naturally.

235
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:58,792
Really?

236
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,833
You have a bad taste.

237
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,250
Bye!

238
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,917

239
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,750

then please contact Mathura Live.

257
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,958
This is Guddu Shukla,
reporting from the lanes of Mathura.

258
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:23,875
<i>You've driven me crazy</i>
<i>I can't live without you</i>

259
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:28,917
<i>Nor tell you what's in my heart</i>

<i>You're my dawn</i>

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,167
<i>And my beautiful night</i>

264
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,917
<i>The world seems wrong</i>

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,833
<i>And you're the right one for me</i>

266
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:53,583
<i>Be my love</i>

267
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,083
<i>Listen to your lover</i>

268
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,042
<i>Be generous to me</i>

<i>I see your photo</i>

00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,500
<i>Many times in a day</i>

271
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,208
<i>I see your photo</i>

00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,542
<i>Many times in a day</i>

273
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,792
<i>There's a storm raging in my heart</i>

<i>Many times in a day</i>

277
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,208
And?

278
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,833
That's all.

279
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,958
What's the matter?
You're going pretty fast today, Shukla.

280
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,708
Your life is on the fast track now.

281
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,083
Chuck it.

282
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,000
You're out of your mind. I am
riding fast because the road's empty.

283
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,083
I see...

284
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,417
And what about that wide smile
you've been wearing all day?

285
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,042
Did you prop up your
lips with a hanger all night?

286
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,708
It's all because of love, my friend.

287
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,375
While looking for new stories,
you've started your love story.

288
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,292
Tell me, what if her father finds out?

289
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,083
When in love, there's no place for fear.

290
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:03,208
Love is never planned. It just happens.

291
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,375
Pretty amazing.

292
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,917
I will pray to God...

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,875
that your love story becomes
immortal like that of Radha-Krishna.

294
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,667
What happened?

295
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,083
You do know that Radha and Krishna
never got married.

296
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:19,083
These things were okay
during Radha-Krishna's time.

297
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,333
But this is a different age now.
This is Mr. Vishnu's age.

298
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,083
And, son, Krishna was a god...

299
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:27,458
and you're an ordinary man
who couldn't even clear college.

300
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:30,333
Uncle, we caught him in the bathroom
with a girl.

301
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,500
Disgusting.

302
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,000
People go there to relieve their bowels
and you were romancing there.

303
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,917
What do we do with him now?

304
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,583
What else?

305
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,708
Give him a proper bath.

306
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll blacken your face and
take you around the city on a donkey.

307
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,458
Elections are around the corner.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,583
Blackening his face will do no good.

309
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,417
Let's shave his head then.

310
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,875
Why are you hell-bent on performing
Mr. Yadav's final rites...

311
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,958
while he's still alive?

312
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,458
Then what else do we do?

313
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,333
How many children does Mr. Yadav have?

314
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,667
He's got four other sons,
not counting this one.

315
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,250
Good.

316
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
Even if one of his
sons becomes a cripple...

317
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,167
the other four can
carry the lineage forward.

318
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,417
Great. Let's go.

319
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,708
<i>Killed me</i>

320
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,875
Bollywood, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Moonwalk

321
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,208
Sunwalk, <i>Kanjivaram</i>, <i>Kuchipudi</i>...

322
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:28,000
festival dance, wedding dance, political
dance, we teach all of the above.

323
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,667
What do you want to learn?

324
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,833
Dance?

325
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,708
I came here to see the plot.

326
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,083
Plot? We have that too.

327
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,917
1BHK, 2BHK, bungalow plot, tower.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,083
And, mister, nothing can beat a bungalow.

329
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,375
Judging by his face, I think
we'll have to show him the cheap ones.

330
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,417
We'll give you a good
deal on an expensive...

331
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:03,667
I'll give this man a good deal
on an expensive plot.

332
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,750
Show him the pictures,
I'll be right back.

333
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,083
Give me the new one.

334
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,208
What's your salary?

335
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,083
This is a new print in chiffon.
It will look stunning on you.

336
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,833
This is another color.

337
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,125
-This?
-Even green will look nice on you.

338
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,875
How much for this one?

339
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,542
This one and this one for 350 rupees.

340
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,083
350 rupees?

341
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,667
-This one?
-Yes.

342
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,792
But it's available in
the market for 100 rupees.

343
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,083
What are you saying, madam?
That's too little.

344
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,833
Why don't you quote your price?

345
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,833
Rs. 55!

346
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,750
Rs. 55?

347
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,167
Yes, Rs. 55 is good.

348
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,792
Take it for free.

349
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,583
That hanky outside costs 55 rupees.

350
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,458
There's a limit to haggling.

351
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:53,125
Fine. I'll pay Rs. 65.

352
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,042
Forget it, ma'am.

353
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,792
-Why?
-Leave it.

354
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,542
You can pay Rs. 100.
This price is only for you.

355
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,667
-Pack it.
-Have you lost it?

356
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Never... I won't sell you this sari
for anything less than Rs. 300.

357
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,917
Strange.

358
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,958
You two are quoting such different prices.

359
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,708
Done.

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,542
-I'll pay Rs. 100.
-Never.

361
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,917
-Rs. 300...
-Wait, Vikas.

362
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,083
Jasmine?

363
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,958
Chandni.

364
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,708
Jasmine.

365
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,500
Myself Babulal.

366
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,417
But people call me Chand.

367
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,292
Who on earth talks to you
or calls you Chand?

368
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,417
Madam, nothing less than 300 rupees.

369
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,583
Take it or leave it.

370
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,083
The deal's done in 100 rupees.
Here are your 100 rupees.

371
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,583
-But how...
-Hey, no arguments.

372
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,167
We can't sell you this sari
for anything less than Rs. 300.

373
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,542
Father...

374
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,625
She'll pay 100 and
I'll pay the remaining 200.

375
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,875
Pay up.

376
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,625
First, pay. Pay up.

377
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,833
Please leave,
we don't want to sell this sari.

378
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,000
Why not?

379
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,500
I said pay him the 200 rupees.

380
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,833
Stop winking at me.
You think you own this shop.

381
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,042
Bloody rascal.

382
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,250
Who do you think you're abusing?

383
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,917
Yes, this is your father's shop.

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,083
Then why don't you handle the business?

385
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,000
Both your brothers sit here
dressed as females all day...

386
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,500
bloody ordinary reporter.

387
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,250
You are going to tell me what to do.

388
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,542
Bloody mutt...

389
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,833
-Control him.
-Stop him.

390
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,500
Don't call me that.
I have a reputation here.

391
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,208
You have developed this area,
haven't you?

392
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,542
Guddu, why do you argue
with him every day? Let him go.

393
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,750
He's my brother-in-law.

394
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,417
Brother, he's a disgrace
to all brothers-in-law.

395
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,250
He comes here to ogle at women.

396
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,875
Guddu, let him go!

397
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,917
And go home.

398
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,333
-Brother-in-law, I may do something.
-What will you do?

399
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,792
Guddu.

400
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,958
-Leave him.
-What are you doing?

401
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,083
I didn't do anything

402
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,958
because you are
my brother-in-law's brother.

403
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,458
But things have gone overboard now.

404
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,667
And yet you're still alive.

405
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,375
I won't die so easily.

406
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,542
But you can burn.

407
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,958
Run fast.

408
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,625
Shall I burn you?

409
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,083
-Brother-in-law!
-Leave me.

410
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,625
Shall I burn you?

411
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,083
Your sister-in-law will kill me.

412
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,875
Mr. Dubey, you want to say

413
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,125
-that they didn't like Vikas, right?
-Yes.

414
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,833
But they also said that
they have no objection

415
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,792
in getting their daughter
married to Guddu.

416
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,792
What nonsense!

417
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,667
When we're trying to
find a bride for Vikas

418
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,083
then how does Guddu
get involved in all this?

419
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,417
Which picture did you send them?

420
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Why didn't you dye your hair?

421
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,792
I did, Mother.

422
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,208
But I wrote my actual date of birth.

423
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:35,083
Mr. Shukla, you won't find such a family.

424
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,000
Why don't you ask Guddu once?
He may agree to marry her.

425
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:41,333
Go on. Let someone get married,
Father-in-law.

426
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,375
At least I'll have a person
to help me out with the chores.

427
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,667
I can't do all these chores alone now.

428
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,042
I'm tired of washing their loin cloths.

429
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,167
Brother-in-law, give your consent.
He's not getting married anytime soon.

430
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,292
What nonsense.

431
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,708
And who wears loin cloths in this house?

432
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,542
-I see...
-That's enough.

433
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:01,125
And you, Mr. Dubey. Why do
you bring such stupid proposals?

434
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,458
Why don't you ever
bring a decent proposal?

435
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,625
How many more proposals
do you expect me to get?

436
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,250
Do you have any idea how many proposals I
sought for you over the last 8 years?

437
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,167
Right.

438
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,542
And the very first proposal
was of my daughter's.

439
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,875
She got married and has three kids now.

440
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,583
I am afraid these two
might remain bachelors forever

441
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,667
and Cheeku gets married first.

442
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,542
Mom, even I want to get married.

443
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,583
Shut up, Cheeku.

444
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,333
He wants to get married.
Do you even know what marriage is?

445
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,292
Even you're unmarried, how do you know?

446
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,792
Cheeku, quiet.

447
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't yell at the kid.

448
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,750
He is talking about getting married.

449
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,417
These days people are living
together without getting married.

450
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,167
-Like that Nazeem Khan.
-Dubey!

451
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,125
Don't you dare talk about him!

452
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,667
You won't utter his name.

453
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:40,333
The celebrities these days.

454
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,333
This is what they are
teaching this generation.

455
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,083
I can't stop thinking
about his parents' ordeal.

456
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,917
It's better not to have children
than to have someone like him.

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,625
-Fine. Calm down. Calm down.
-Bravo. Bravo.

458
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,042
Don't spoil your health
for that shameless man.

459
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,333
Mr. Dubey, you tell us what to do next.

460
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,708
They are looking for someone
with a high-profile job.

461
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,042
Mr. Dubey, no job's too big or small.

462
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,083
Great.

463
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,833
Then why don't you handle
the sari business?

464
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,292
Has the doctor advised you to come on TV?

465
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,625
Why are you interfering?

466
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:15,583
Father, please tell him
to keep his mouth shut

467
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,167
-or else I will kick him out some day...
-Just a minute.

468
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,708
Dubey, there's no room for debate on this.

469
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,458
I said I don't approve of
this proposal then that's final.

470
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,083
Go and tell them that.

471
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,792
Fine.

472
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,542
But there's one thing
that's still unclear to me.

473
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:36,125
The younger brother is getting
married before the elder one. How?

474
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,083
Who's getting him married?

475
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,583
Whoever gets married first,
what is your problem?

476
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,292
What do you mean by that?

477
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,667
Look at that, Father.

478
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,750
I think his intentions are evil.

479
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,750
Babulal is right about you.

480
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,042
Who are you guys to
form an opinion on me?

481
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:54,125
And I'll get married whenever I want.
I'll get married before you if I want to.

482
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,708
-You'll do it first!
-Who's older amongst us?

483
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,667
-Vikas--
-I am older.

484
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,667
So I will get married first.

485
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,500
And if you get married before me,
I'll beat you to pulp.

486
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,000
Now you just watch.

487
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,333
I was just contemplating this idea
but now I've decided.

488
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:12,458
Brother. Book a wedding venue.
Now I will get married first.

489
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,792
Vikas, remember what I had said.

490
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,792
He will get married before you.

491
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:20,458
And if that happens,
the society will look down upon you.

492
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,250
Cheeku.

493
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,667
-You rascal...
-Listen...

494
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,208
No one would want to
let their daughter marry you.

495
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,750
-They'll say that your system's rusted.
-Is your system working good?

496
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,792
Why don't you yell out
louder and let everyone know?

497
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,458
Why is he shouting?

498
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,500
Father, you be quiet.

499
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,042
<i>Take my advice, Guddu, and get married.</i>

500
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,583
<i>I am afraid these two</i>
<i>might remain bachelors forever</i>

501
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:41,958
<i>and Cheeku gets married first.</i>

502
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,750
<i>Cheeku's uncle, bless him.</i>

503
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,375
A suit in this weather?
Were you attending a wedding?

504
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,500
Wedding... Yes... I mean no.

505
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,083
You're looking nice.

506
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,833
So what was so important?

507
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,875
Hello, Brother.
What on earth are you doing?

508
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,125
Brother?

509
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,833
-I came to propose to you.
-Marriage?

510
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,000
Are you out of your mind?
What is this charade?

511
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,500
This is not a charade, just my feelings.

512
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,958
You do love me, don't you?

513
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,708
Yes, Guddu. But love and
marriage are two different things.

514
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,958
I am not ready to get married yet.

515
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:43,208
I mean... I still have to go to Delhi,
get a job, become a journalist.

516
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,458
And I am not stopping you from doing
any of this.

517
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,625
But you can do all this after marriage.

518
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,125
And we'll settle down
in Delhi, post wedding.

519
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,500
Even my career will take off in Delhi.

520
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,167
But I don't know you so well, Guddu.

521
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,833
How can I marry you on such short notice?

522
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,167
I am not telling you
to get married right now.

523
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,333
But marry only me.

524
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,667
Whether we do it now or later,
we must get to know each other better.

525
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,042
And we can never do that
if we keep meeting secretly.

526
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,750
What else do you want to know?
I am like an open book.

527
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,667
And one needs time
to read an open book. So...

528
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,792
Remember what that old lady said?

529
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,917
If she had any idea that her
husband is a drunkard

530
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,625
she would never have married him.

531
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,625
But I don't drink at all
and you know that.

532
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,208
It's not about alcohol.

533
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,875
Then what is it?

534
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,042
Sit down. Sit.

535
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,792
Look, Guddu,
I've already made this mistake once.

536
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,000
And I don't want to do it again.

537
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,250
So until we don't spend
some quality time together...

538
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,167
Let's do this.

539
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,708
We should go for a live-in.

540
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,708
-What?
-What?

541
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,833
I'm saying that we should
go for a live-in first.

542
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,583
How can you bring that topic up?

543
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,125
Technically it comes before the wedding.

544
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,375
We should give it a try too. Everyone is.

545
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,125
Everybody in Delhi and Mumbai do it.

546
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,833
The population of Delhi and Mumbai
is over 20 million, Rashmi.

547
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,333
Perhaps it's easy to do it there.

548
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,417
And we're in Mathura, it's a small city.

549
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,333
We can't walk hand-in-hand,
how do you expect us to go for a live-in?

550
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,000
Moreover Nazeem Khan has created
quite a stir in the city.

551
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,875
Even brothers and sisters can't step out
of their home because of your father.

552
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,417
And you want to go for a live-in with me.

553
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,417
Why are you such a wimp?
It's a matter of a few days.

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,708
Let's try staying together for a few days.

555
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:30,000
If everything goes well,
I can give marriage a thought. Yeah!

556
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,750
I don't get it.

557
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,958
Despite being a girl, I'm not afraid of
a live-in, why are you so scared?

558
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,750
Gender is not the problem, Rashmi.

559
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,208
I am a well-known person in Mathura.

560
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,833
Even the dogs and cats
of this city know me.

561
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,542
Your father is pretty well acquainted too.

562
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,375
Here we're always on our toes

563
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,417
so that no one recognizes us.

564
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,917
I don't understand how
we will go for a live-in.

565
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,583
And when? What will we tell our family?

566
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,292
And the most important question

567
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,542
where are we going to stay?

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,833
-Gwalior.
-Gwalior.

569
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:04,875
What Gwalior?

570
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:08,625
We are going to Gwalior
to cover the Municipal Elections.

571
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:11,500
It's a 20-day job.
And we'll request Mr. Pandey

572
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,333
to send Rashmi with us too. That's it.

573
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,125
You mean to say that we should
go to Gwalior for 20 days.

574
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,250
Do our job and also try
our hand at a live-in relationship?

575
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,500
-Absolutely.
-That's great.

576
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:25,875
What an idea, Abbas. You're brilliant.

577
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,917
That I am.
This is the best idea you can get.

578
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,417
Away from your family.
Tell them it's an official trip.

579
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,667
And get what you want.

580
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,792
Why? What are you thinking now?

581
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,167
What is the problem now?

582
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,000
It's far away from home.
And no one knows you out there.

583
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,083
So no one will know
and we can do what we intend to.

584
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,458
Done.

585
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,667
Done. Done.

586
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,875
You two look cute together.

587
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,167
<i>Father, whatever you taught me</i>

588
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:21,000
<i>Whatever I have gained from you</i>
<i>I'll take to my groom's home</i>

589
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:29,583
<i>I'll take it to my groom's home</i>

590
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,250
<i>I'll take it to my groom's home</i>

591
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,708
<i>With fond memories</i>
<i>I go to a strange house</i>

592
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,625
<i>Your dearest</i>

593
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,625
Uncle!

594
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:12,583
<i>How will I manage to forget, Father</i>

595
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:18,042
<i>The stories that you have told me?</i>

596
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:22,417
<i>I'm going to leave behind</i>

597
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,292
<i>All the memories of childhood...</i>

598
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,542
-Did you check the hotels?
-No, I'll do it now.

599
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,042
Why stay in a hotel?

600
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,500
Why go for a live-in
if you're going to stay at a hotel?

601
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,542
Is it written in the scriptures

602
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,542
that during a live-in,
we can't stay in a hotel?

603
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,083
Unbelievable.

604
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,833
Tell me, when does
a boy and a girl stay at a hotel?

605
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,250
-When?
-That's what I am asking.

606
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,208
When does a young girl and a young boy

607
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,000
stay at a hotel for 15-20 days?

608
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,250
-On their honeymoon.
-Honeymoon.

609
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,750
That's the right answer.
And when does one go on a honeymoon?

610
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,083
-After the wedding.
-After the wedding.

611
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,000
And when does one go for a live-in?

612
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,208
Before the wedding.

613
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,625
Exactly. Then why do you need a hotel?

614
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,792
And anyway, living in a hotel is not
considered a live-in relationship.

615
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:09,833
When a boy and a girl stay

616
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,000
in the same house as husband and wife
without getting married,

617
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,000
that's called a live-in relationship.
Simple.

618
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,292
Are you an expert on this subject?

619
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,042
How does it matter whether
we live in a hotel or a house?

620
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,750
It does matter. Abbas is absolutely right.

621
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,792
As long as we don't live in
the same house as husband and wife

622
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,125
-we'll never get to know each other.
-Yes.

623
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,083
And everything is available
in the hotel on demand.

624
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,000
The staff cleans the room for you.

625
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,625
Food's available on a phone call.

626
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:33,500
And they even do the laundry.

627
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,792
Girls are intelligent.

628
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,083
Other than this,
there's only one thing left to do.

629
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,625
For which, you'll need a bed.

630
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,042
If that's on your mind,
you can book a hotel.

631
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,292
No, we're not going to do that.

632
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:43,333
What do you mean?

633
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:44,708
Means?

634
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:48,125
I mean we'll do everything
that a husband and wife normally do.

635
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,333
So?

636
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,333
Well, a husband and wife do that as well.

637
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,417
Don't get too excited
and keep your eyes on the road.

638
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,292
Think of a way to get a house in Gwalior.

639
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,750
I didn't hear anything.

640
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,792
<i>O my beloved</i>

641
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,708
What was the name of the hero
who featured in that song?

642
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:13,917
-Nazeem Khan.
-Yeah, Nazeem Khan.

643
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,542
Even you two are in a similar situation.

644
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,375
Great.

645
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,917
-But there's a problem.
-What is it?

646
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,417
Have you heard about
the Culture Protection Party?

647
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,708
What about them?

648
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:34,375
They created quite a stir after that news.

649
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,208
Their party workers are a bunch of dogs.

650
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,083
-What are they?
-Dogs?

651
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,625
You mean we can't get a room anywhere.

652
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,292
At least not in Gwalior.

653
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,667
Where are you going?

654
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,417
I said it's difficult but possible.

655
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,917
-Sit.
-Meaning?

656
00:32:55,583 --> 00:33:00,375
I mean, only I know
that you two are not married.

657
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,125
And I am not going to tell this to anyone.

658
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,583
And if you don't tell anyone either

659
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,208
then no one will know.

660
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,375
Secret.

661
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,125
What is marriage?

662
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:15,125
Wear a nuptial chain
and vermilion on your forehead.

663
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,375
And you are married.

664
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:20,375
No one's going to ask you for
your marriage certificate. Right?

665
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,208
And even if someone does,
we'll arrange for that too.

666
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,792
Everything's available here.

667
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,625
One can get a death certificate
for a man who's still alive.

668
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,417
I got one for my uncle when he fell sick.

669
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,917
-Property matters are a real hassle.
-I don't mind.

670
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,792
All it takes is a little vermilion
and a nuptial chain.

671
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,292
-That's all.
-I am ready.

672
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,417
-Yes.
-Yes.

673
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,917
So what now? Shall we proceed?

674
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,417
Come on.

675
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,833
Come, sir. Come.

676
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,500
Here's your little love nest.

677
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,000
For an entire month.

678
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,625
It has got everything you need.

679
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:55,333
And the best part is
that the owner lives abroad.

680
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,333
He comes here only once in a year.

681
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,208
He came down here last month
and will be back next year.

682
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,750
But this one's Indian.

683
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:04,958
Exactly, madam, Indian.
Everything in here is Indian.

684
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:07,583
East or West, India is the best. Tell me?

685
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,417
How is the water facility?

686
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,833
24/7, ma'am. In fact,
even the rainwater seeps directly in.

687
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,833
We're not going to stay that long.

688
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,042
And what about the neighbors?
I hope they won't create problems.

689
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,875
No problems at all. I am here.

690
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,250
So we've to pay you
Rs. 6000 for this place?

691
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,333
What?

692
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,458
-Rs. 10,000.
-But you just said Rs. 6000.

693
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,583
That rate is for a married couple.

694
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,917
And you're going to stay
here without a license

695
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,833
so it's going to cost you extra.

696
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,875
What do you mean without a licence?

697
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,458
Meaning without getting married.

698
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,833
Marriage is the licence
to do anything you want.

699
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,625
Since you're going to do
things without getting married

700
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,083
you'll have to pay the fine.

701
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,125
Just like you do if you
drive a car without a licence.

702
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,208
Yes, we get it. Pay him.

703
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,333
Here you go.

704
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,708
This is for keeping your mouth shut,
for the days to come.

705
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,708
-Keep it.
-Thank you.

706
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,333
Now you won't face any problems.

707
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,875
I guarantee you that.

708
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,583
Hello. Hello...

709
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,583
Myself Soni Shrivastav.

710
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,792
I live in the house no. 12.

711
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:13,500
Are you guys the new tenants?

712
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:14,792
Yes.

713
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:18,083
He's Mr. Guddu.
And that's his wife Rashmi.

714
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,458
And he's Abbas.

715
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,125
-Hello!
-Hello.

716
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,667
So when are you guys moving in?

717
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:30,958
-Well, we just did.
-Okay.

718
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,875
And it's a lucky day. Tuesday.

719
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,875
It is a very auspicious day.

720
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,708
I watch Ramanand Baba's predictions
on television every day.

721
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,042
Actually... I see all the programs on TV.

722
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:50,125
Why don't you install
cable TV in your home too?

723
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,417
I'll give you their number.

724
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,542
Yeah...

725
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:56,458
In today's age,
you can do without a husband

726
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,167
-but not without a cable TV.
-Yes.

727
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,167
Well, then see you in the evening.
Right, Rashmi?

728
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,708
Yeah, see you in the evening.

729
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,542
-Thank you.
-Thank God!

730
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:12,500
Just a minute.
I forgot to ask where you are from.

731
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,167
-Allahabad.
-Benaras.

732
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,708
She's from Allahabad.

733
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,458
He's from Benaras.

734
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,917
And he's from Kanpur.

735
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,833
And I am from Gwalior.
Right? Here's my card.

736
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,667
Okay.

737
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:35,625
Bye.

738
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,125
Bye, dear.

739
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:03,042
Grapes, mango, strawberry...

740
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,375
The shower doesn't work.
It's there as a showpiece.

741
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,125
I had to use the bucket instead.

742
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,958
Back in Delhi, every house had a shower.

743
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,458
Are you going to say something?
I am speaking to you.

744
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,708
I am listening.

745
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,583
What did you hear?

746
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,917
It's a nice home, isn't it?

747
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,042
Very nice.

748
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,500
Come on, now let's sleep.

749
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:39,625
So soon? It's just 1 a.m.

750
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,667
It's 1 a.m. Now sleep.

751
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,042
Are you asleep?

752
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,417
No. Why?

753
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,500
I can't sleep.

754
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,125
Wake up.

755
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,250
And what do you expect me to do, Guddu?

756
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:29,375
I read an article on live-in
relationships, on Google.

757
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:34,708
It was a really nice article.

758
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,750
It explained what to do

759
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,500
how to do and in which way.

760
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,458
Just like Abbas said.

761
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,875
Live-in is about living
together like a husband and wife.

762
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,167
Understood?

763
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,875
Are you asleep?

764
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,625
Guddu.

765
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,875
I am very tired.

766
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,833
Actually, do we have protection?

767
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,875
We do. Lots of it
and in different varieties too.

768
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,625
You're cute.

769
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,250
-I'd eaten a lot of butter in childhood.
-Really.

770
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,958
Guddu, careful.

771
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,875
I am the only guy from Shukla family

772
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,917
who's getting this experience
before getting married.

773
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,208
How does one open this damn thing?

774
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,792
-You know... Google's...
-Yes.

775
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,500
...really amazing.

776
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,875
One should always follow what it says.

777
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,792
I want to do it again.

778
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:25,958
Do it.

779
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,792
I am not getting that.

780
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,417
Who has come?

781
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,625
Hello, son. Good morning.

782
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,000
Good morning, ma'am.

783
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,042
-Where is your wife?
-Which one?

784
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,500
Which one? How many wives do you have?

785
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,917
I am talking about Rashmi.

786
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,625
-My wife Rashmi?
-Yes.

787
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,958
She's still asleep.

788
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,375
Anything urgent?

789
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:08,167
No, I just wanted to say that if
you need anything feel free to ask.

790
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,875
Yes, of course.

791
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,625
-Bye, son.
-Bye.

792
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,792
What a peculiar woman.

793
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:17,958
The one who can't live without cable TV?

794
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,875
Yeah. She's always
snooping around our house.

795
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,083
That's too much water,
it's completely dissolved.

796
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,792
I can't eat this.

797
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:41,083
You'll have to eat whatever we have.
This is all we'll get in Gwalior.

798
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,208
Mr. Gwalior, I'll handle the cooking,
no need to worry.

799
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:46,792
You take care of the washing,
cleaning, dishes, etcetera.

800
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,667
I should do all the work
and you only cook for two people.

801
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,458
You know what, you handle the cooking,
cleaning and dishes.

802
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,583
And I'll do the rest.

803
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:58,167
Okay. But you'll clean
the toilet and bathroom.

804
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,792
You clean the toilet
and I'll clean the bathroom.

805
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:02,667
Come on, Guddu, that's the least
you can do. It doesn't take that long.

806
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,458
And I'll handle the cooking,
you got to do all the chopping.

807
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,500
-That's not my cup of tea.
-I am not chopping anything, Rashmi.

808
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,333
I am not asking, I am telling you.

809
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,042
Now make me a nice cup of tea.

810
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,042
And I don't like ginger, so
don't forget to add cardamoms.

811
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,333
Lots of cardamoms, huh?

812
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:19,167
I'll show you.

813
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:20,792
Run...

814
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,917
<i>My heart calls out to you</i>

815
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,292
<i>Let's build our own little world</i>

816
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,292
<i>My heart calls out to you</i>

817
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,667
<i>Let's build our own little world</i>

818
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,750
<i>I can't stand any distance between us</i>

819
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,875
<i>Just you and me, and no one else</i>

820
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,875
<i>Everything that's mine is yours too</i>

821
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:53,083
<i>You can keep my share of happiness too</i>

822
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,125
<i>I take your name with every breath</i>

823
00:42:56,208 --> 00:43:00,167
<i>And my heart beats for you</i>

824
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,250
We're building 15 temples
all over Gwalior.

825
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,542
Now you can ask God for anything you want.

826
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:18,625
Roads, electricity, water.
Anything you want.

827
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:22,250
You'll get everything you wish for.
But only when you have faith.

828
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:26,333
What an amazing ideology of
the Culture Protection Party.

829
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,667
They are such uncomplicated people.

830
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:36,125
<i>I can't get enough of you</i>

831
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:43,042
<i>Nothing affects me now</i>

832
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:49,042
<i>You're my love, my life</i>
<i>And my world</i>

833
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,708
<i>All I can think of is you</i>

834
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:55,333
<i>Without you</i>
<i>A moment seems like forever</i>

835
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:58,583
<i>My heart calls out to you</i>

836
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,625
<i>Let's build our own little world</i>

837
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,167
<i>If you're ever sad, I'll make you laugh</i>

838
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,708
<i>You can keep my share of happiness</i>

839
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:11,000
<i>I take your name with every breath</i>

840
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:15,417
<i>And my heart beats for you</i>

841
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:24,583
Sister, you have this
knack of snooping around.

842
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,417
I don't believe you.

843
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:30,125
Sometimes she wears the nuptial chain,
sometimes she doesn't.

844
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,583
Sometimes I see the anointment
on her forehead, sometimes I don't.

845
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:36,792
I am sure she does
but you must have missed it.

846
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,458
I am telling you.

847
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:42,167
I saw them and heard everything.

848
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:44,417
They were dividing
the chores amongst them.

849
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,792
They were running around
in the house like little children.

850
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,625
In their underpants.

851
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:52,375
We've been married for so many years.

852
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:55,042
But my husband never chased me,
in his underpants.

853
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,083
Right?

854
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,958
My husband wears a lungi.

855
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,958
Doesn't he wear underpants?

856
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,500
Mrs. Kohli, you've very naive.

857
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:09,958
<i>I learnt to laugh</i>
<i>Only after I met you</i>

858
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:16,792
<i>I learnt to live my life</i>

859
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:22,958
<i>I've forgotten the world</i>
<i>Ever since I met you</i>

860
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,000
<i>You're my heart, my love</i>

861
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:29,125
<i>I can't stop talking about you</i>

862
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:32,208
<i>My heart calls out to you</i>

863
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:35,375
<i>Let's build our own little world</i>

864
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,625
<i>If you're ever sad, I'll make you laugh</i>

865
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,500
<i>You can keep my share of happiness</i>

866
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:44,750
<i>I take your name with every breath</i>

867
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:49,542
<i>And I breathe as your heart beats</i>

868
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:55,167
<i>The path of love brought me this far</i>

869
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,833
<i>Finally I understood</i>

870
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:03,167
<i>The meaning of love</i>

871
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,292
<i>Never leave me, sweetheart</i>

872
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:16,542
<i>I'll be lost</i>

873
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,458
Hello, dear. How are you?

874
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,167
Hello, ma'am.

875
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,000
Sorry for troubling you at this hour.

876
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:28,125
-But my husband's in the mood...
-What?

877
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,167
-For a cup of tea, dear.
-Okay.

878
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,625
Can I borrow some milk?

879
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,625
Yes, of course. Come in.

880
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,167
-Come in.
-Okay.

881
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,292
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, son.

882
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:45,292
Thank you.

883
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,333
So, son, how's work?

884
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,542
-Work?
-Yes.

885
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,750
It's amazing.

886
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,625
Great.

887
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,958
For how long have you two been married?

888
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:25,583
-1 year
-6 months.

889
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:27,875
-6 months
-1 year.

890
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,083
Great.

891
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,708
See you then.

892
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:35,375
Bye-bye, dear.

893
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,375
-Mrs. Kohli.
-Yes.

894
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,042
-Mrs. Kohli.
-Yes.

895
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,625
Listen, Mrs. Kohli.

896
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,417
What's wrong?

897
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,417
Didn't I tell you, Mrs. Kohli?

898
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,458
I caught those two red-handed today.

899
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:55,792
Yes.

900
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,625
They have no clue how
long they've been married for.

901
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,500
Now it's confirmed that they
are in a live-in relationship.

902
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,042
And it's all that Nazeem Khan's fault.

903
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,458
People like him are
a blot on our society.

904
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:09,458
-Yes. And on our neighborhood too.
-Yes.

905
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:14,000
Mr. Kohli, now you must throw
those two out at the crack of dawn.

906
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:16,500
-We're dead.
-Yes, we're dead.

907
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,708
What now?

908
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:20,333
We should've already decided
on how long we were married.

909
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:21,833
You should've thought about it, Guddu.

910
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:23,667
And why can't you
ever give the same reply?

911
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,542
If dad finds out about this,
he'll bury you alive.

912
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:50,833
-Respectable people live here.
-Right.

913
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:53,833
-Decent people live here.
-We must throw them out.

914
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:57,208
-We can't allow them here.
-Such people can't live here.

915
00:48:57,292 --> 00:49:00,125
-I wonder how they came here!
-Throw them out.

916
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,375
Come. Let's see.

917
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:05,167
Knock the door.

918
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,792
-Call them out.
-Decent people...

919
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,667
You? And with all these people?

920
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,750
-Please come in.
-Move aside.

921
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:17,167
Come inside everyone and see for yourself.

922
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,708
Hello.

923
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,917
They are married.

924
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,792
Yes.

925
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,333
They...

926
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,083
They...

927
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,792
They are married.

928
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,458
I swear this wasn't here.

929
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,042
And this was definitely not here. Really.

930
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,417
I swear on Ramanand Baba. Honestly.

931
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,750
He is lying.

932
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,208
They are looking so cute here.

933
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,875
Listen, dear.

934
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,042
Wow! You people have come
on a very nice day.

935
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,042
Nice day?

936
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:16,667
You see, it is our
first wedding anniversary.

937
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:20,667
-Have sweets.
-Congratulations.

938
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,375
Congratulations...

939
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,167
-But she said...
-Have a sweet, ma'am.

940
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,292
Let's go.

941
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,667
After all,
it's an auspicious day for us. Smile.

942
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:55,792
-We just breezed through these 20 days.
-Right?

943
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,167
These were the most
beautiful 20 days of my life.

944
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,167
Mine too.

945
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,375
I'm getting a very
strong feeling about this.

946
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,542
Then what's the next step?

947
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,917
Next step?

948
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,500
What's that?

949
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,708
Well, for starters,
it can be what we came here for.

950
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:23,708
We'll see.

951
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,417
-Let's go.
-What's wrong?

952
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,208
Nothing.

953
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,583
Something's definitely wrong. What is it?

954
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,000
I did all this for you.

955
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,750
And you're still uncertain.

956
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,625
I love you a lot, Rashmi.

957
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,417
I've no clue how much
Lord Krishna loved Radha.

958
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,250
But I can bet you that
I don't love you any less.

959
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:52,625
I've imagined my entire life with you.

960
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,542
And we look really happy.

961
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,958
But there's one thing
that always scares me.

962
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,833
What if you refuse to marry me?

963
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,000
Why do you think that I'll refuse?

964
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,167
I don't know.

965
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,667
What if the perfume fades away?

966
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:14,708
Even if it does, you smell nice naturally.

967
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,083
I am not in the mood to joke, Rashmi.

968
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,583
Have you ever been to Jaipur?

969
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:29,917
It's the best place
for a destination wedding.

970
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,167
-Is it?
-Jaipur.

971
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,042
-Jaipur!
-Yes.

972
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:43,125
People are watching. Control yourself.

973
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:44,667
How can I control myself?

974
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,083
I can hear the wedding bells.

975
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,625
Can't you ever slow down?

976
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,500
We leave for Mathura tomorrow.

977
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,333
Then talk to our parents.

978
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:56,417
And then you can imagine
all the wedding bells you want.

979
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,958
-Happy?
-Yes.

980
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,667
You came to Gwalior with me.

981
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,167
But you're always
busy staring at other girls.

982
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,000
-I am looking at the guy.
-Why?

983
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,833
Are you interested in guys as well?

984
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:17,333
No. Hold this.

985
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,042
She's a married woman.

986
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,375
Even I am married.
Or have you forgotten that?

987
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:34,708
No.

988
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:35,958
Who is he?

989
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,042
Forget him, Bobby.

990
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,917
Fooling around with a married woman.

991
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,292
But I won't let you
have all the fun alone.

992
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,250
I want it too.

993
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,958
What do you want?

994
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:53,083
Go back to the hotel.
I'll see you in an hour.

995
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,042
Make that two.

996
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:00,958
Shall we go?

997
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:34,542
Nice tires.

998
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,833
-Happy Holi, ma'am.
-Holi?

999
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:57,875
Hi.

1000
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,333
Mad man.

1001
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:23,625
I'll get that.

1002
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,125
Yes?

1003
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,958
Tell Guddu I am here. And I want some too.

1004
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:35,792
What do you want?

1005
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,750
The same that Guddu...

1006
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:41,667
Yes?

1007
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,708
What do you want?

1008
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,542
Do you want a towel?

1009
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,458
Are you okay?

1010
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:54,958
What do you want?

1011
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,375
What do you want?

1012
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,125
-Who was it, Rashmi?
-It was some weird guy.

1013
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,958
He said he wants something
and was talking about you. He just fled.

1014
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,000
He talked about me and fled?

1015
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:11,000
There's only one such man.

1016
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,417
And he's in Mathura.

1017
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,208

We are doomed.

1033
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,125
Vikas, remember what I said?

1034
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,875
Your younger brother
will get married before you.

1035
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,083
Now look.

1036
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,208
Now you'll have to spend
the rest of your life alone.

1037
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,667
Didn't you feel ashamed
before doing any of this?

1038
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,833
Did you ever think what will happen to me?

1039
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:06,833
You rascal. Stop look at her. Look at me.

1040
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:09,292
You wanted to get married, didn't you?
Didn't you?

1041
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,375
Couldn't you have waited for a few days?

1042
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,333
Even I was getting some proposals.

1043
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:14,333
Vikas! What is going on here?

1044
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:19,792
Get out.

1045
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,708
What is this?

1046
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:32,667
You should know

1047
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:36,042
that no one in Shukla family
has ever done such a thing.

1048
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:41,167
The younger brother
got married before the elder one.

1049
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,917
Nobody eloped and got married.

1050
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,292
But you wanted to change
the course of history, didn't you?

1051
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,667
Which you did.

1052
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,333
Are you happy now?

1053
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,500
Why did you do such a thing?

1054
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:59,292
Why did you elope and get married?

1055
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,458
Such a nice girl.

1056
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:04,833
I admit that she's underdressed.

1057
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:09,167
We would've let you marry her.
You could've asked us once.

1058
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,500
At least you could've told me once.

1059
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,167
Look, Mom, strawberry.

1060
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:25,208
Cheeku.

1061
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,000
Guddu, shameless.

1062
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,375
How can you leave this thing lying around?

1063
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:34,917
I didn't expect this from you.

1064
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:39,333
Imagine our reputation in the society now.

1065
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:41,375
Forget your reputation.

1066
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,542
Think about poor Vikas.
His life's ruined now.

1067
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:46,042
He'll die a bachelor now.

1068
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,250
Very sad.

1069
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:52,000
-Whatever happened wasn't fair.
-Get lost!

1070
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,708
There's no way brother Vikas
can face anyone now.

1071
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,792
You bloody...
Will you both shut up?

1072
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:01,792
This is our personal matter.
So please don't interfere.

1073
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:03,417
Stop yelling at my brother.

1074
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,125
What's done, is done.

1075
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:09,458
Now we need to ask her whether she
can handle the household chores or not.

1076
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:11,500
Be quiet, Sister-in-law. Be quiet!

1077
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,792
And why can't he speak?

1078
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,083
What family? Which family?

1079
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:19,042
A family where the younger brother
has no respect for his elder brother.

1080
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,917
Thankfully, Babulal informed us on time.

1081
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,875
Or else he was planning
on eloping with her.

1082
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,417
Look. His bag's packed.

1083
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,750
How did this happen?

1084
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,083
Where to, Mr. Khan? You were
the only one missing in the picture.

1085
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,167
Please. Didn't you bring your
camera along?

1086
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,500
Abbas.

1087
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,292
Abbas.

1088
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:47,583
So you knew all about this.

1089
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,083
I am asking you a question. Did you know?

1090
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,167
-Yes.
-There you go.

1091
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,875
Everyone knows except for our family.

1092
01:00:57,833 --> 01:00:59,542
Stop staring at her.
We know the entire story.

1093
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:01,167
We're just missing your version.

1094
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:04,167
At least you could've told us.

1095
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,833
Or at least stopped them
from doing such a thing.

1096
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,708
What could I possibly say?

1097
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:15,375
All I can say is that
forget what happened.

1098
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,500
And forgive them.

1099
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,417
And get these two married.

1100
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,125
Marriage.

1101
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,667
Have you lost it?

1102
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,583
How can we get them married again?

1103
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,167
Are you on drugs or something?

1104
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,458
You mean they won't get married?

1105
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:31,708
Have you lost it?

1106
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,125
When they are already married

1107
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,875
-then why get them married again?
-Right.

1108
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:36,958
Married?

1109
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:39,000
When?

1110
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,542
Oh yes, they are already married. Look.

1111
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,083
See this picture, this frame.

1112
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,083
They took their wedding vows
in my presence.

1113
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,958
But unfortunately, none of you were there.

1114
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,292
I mean get them married again.

1115
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,833
For the sake of the society.

1116
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:04,167
They just need your blessings.

1117
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,208
Yes, do that.

1118
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,458
This is right.

1119
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:09,375
We just need your blessings, Mother.

1120
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:14,542
Yes, ma'am, no wedding is complete
without the blessings of the parents.

1121
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:16,417
Will you two shut up?

1122
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,125
You didn't tell us anything
about your parents.

1123
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:20,542
Who are they?

1124
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,000
-Yes.
-Yes?

1125
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,542
Who?

1126
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:26,500
That...

1127
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,917
I had warned you about this.

1128
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,917
But my fear turned out to be true.

1129
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:40,792
What on earth have you done, Rashmi?

1130
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:43,500
Didn't you think about
your father's reputation?

1131
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,125
Elections are around the corner.

1132
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,833
We'll become a laughing stock
of the city.

1133
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:54,083
And you said, "Shrikant, I'll be
the next MP, the next minister, the CM."

1134
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:58,042
Now when they expel you from the party,
all your dreams will be shattered.

1135
01:02:58,625 --> 01:02:59,917
I am feeling dizzy.

1136
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,625
Everything's over now, Uncle.

1137
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:05,833
Dear, what have you done?

1138
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,000
-What have you done?
-Aunt is crying.

1139
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:12,292
You could've told us once.

1140
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:16,917
He's such a nice boy, such a nice family.

1141
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,042
You should've tried telling us once.

1142
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,583
We would've let you marry him.

1143
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,708
-I've something to say.
-Here comes the bad luck.

1144
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,750
I know none of this is right.

1145
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:38,167
But nothing is over yet.

1146
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:46,292
For your sake and for the sake of society

1147
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,583
you should get them married again.

1148
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:49,792
What say?

1149
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,917
-What is he saying?
-Best idea.

1150
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,917
-Come closer.
-Yes.

1151
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:03,958
In our culture,
marriage is a one-time affair.

1152
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,875
And they are already married, got it?

1153
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:10,667
But, Uncle, how are we going
to explain any of this to the people?

1154
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,250
Like when did they get married?
Why didn't we inform anyone?

1155
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,417
We've been promoting
our culture for ages now...

1156
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,500
but your very own daughter
just put all your efforts to waste.

1157
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:24,083
I'm telling you, we've been cursed
by all the lovers that we humiliated.

1158
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:29,000
The highest leader of Culture Protection
Party, Vishnu Prasad Trivedi's daughter...

1159
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:30,542
eloped and got married.

1160
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:31,708
This is going to create a stir.

1161
01:04:31,792 --> 01:04:33,583
There will be no such thing.

1162
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,875
Keep your mouth shut.

1163
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,583
I know how to tell the people about this.

1164
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,167
They eloped and got married.

1165
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,875
Well, at least they are married.

1166
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:54,333
And not in a live-in relationship
like that rascal Nazeem Khan.

1167
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,292
-Yes.
-Yes.

1168
01:04:58,042 --> 01:04:59,125
Sir?

1169
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:04,292
What if we were in a live-in relationship?

1170
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,083
You are telling this in front of uncle.

1171
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,083
I will clobber you.

1172
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:10,958
What is he saying?

1173
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,292
Then a number of bodies would
be floating in the Yamuna River.

1174
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:28,042
-Count them.
-They are six.

1175
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,458
Their bodies.

1176
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,708
Understood?

1177
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,583
-Shrikant.
-Yes, uncle.

1178
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:35,667
Come here.

1179
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,292
I don't want to see that guy again.

1180
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,958
-Understood?
-Yes, Uncle.

1181
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:52,458
Hey...

1182
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,042
No, I'm not talking to you.

1183
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:09,083
We're in conversation with the ex-MP
of Mathura Mr. Vishnu Trivedi.

1184
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,708
Let's begin our conversation with him.

1185
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,458
It's a very happy day for him

1186
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:15,917
because it's the wedding
of his only daughter Rashmi.

1187
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,208
It's done...

1188
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:18,500
-They just got married.
-They did?

1189
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,458
Yes.

1190
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,000
So, Mr. Vishnu, my question to you is

1191
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:23,875
how do you feel after this wedding?

1192
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:27,000
It feels really nice.
It feels really very nice.

1193
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:33,917
My dear daughter is married
to a very talented young man Bunnu--

1194
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,375
Guddu Shukla.

1195
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,333
...with Guddu Shukla.

1196
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:42,333
We received many
proposals for our daughter.

1197
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,333
From rich families.

1198
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,208
Many proposals.

1199
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:50,750
But I wanted my daughter
to marry someone from a poor family.

1200
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:51,875
Yes. Right.

1201
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,750
They are very poor people.

1202
01:06:55,042 --> 01:07:00,458
But as you know that I don't
believe in caste, creed or community.

1203
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:02,542
But the boy's from a Brahmin family.

1204
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:06,458
And they have a huge
sari shop in Mathura Market.

1205
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,458
Pardon my insolence
but I do have a question, sir.

1206
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:10,542
Yes, of course.

1207
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,625
It's your only daughter's wedding.

1208
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,458
Why didn't you invite anyone?

1209
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:24,417
Because it was my father,

1210
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:28,583
Late Dwarkadas Trivedi's last wish.

1211
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:31,458
That his granddaughter's wedding

1212
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:35,292
-be a private affair.
-Right.

1213
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:36,792
A personal affair, understood?

1214
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:39,375
Why did he have such a weird last wish?

1215
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,250
We don't know.

1216
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,417
Why don't you ask him personally? Shall I?

1217
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,333
No... I get it.

1218
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:54,417
Ask him.

1219
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,667
-Priest.
-Yes.

1220
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:08,083
The groom's here, so is the bride,
the garlands and the guests.

1221
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:12,458
So shall we take our wedding vows?

1222
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:13,375
Go ahead.

1223
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,750
But who's going chant the hymns?

1224
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,917
Why, sir, can't you?

1225
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:20,792
I only look like a priest
but I am not one.

1226
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,708
I sell fritters outside.

1227
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:25,208
Mr. Shrikant called me in a hurry and said

1228
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:27,625
I should walk out
with you two when he calls.

1229
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:31,042
The wedding's done.

1230
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,000
-Hey, fake priest, get them here.
-Yes...

1231
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,667
You both are married now.
Seek blessings of your parents.

1232
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,333
Come on hurry up.

1233
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:41,667
You're the bride and groom,
so show that you're happy.

1234
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,375
This is not a funeral. Smile.

1235
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:45,625
Come on, fast.

1236
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:49,167
Our Rashmi's husband and
our brother-in-law is here.

1237
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,167
Now everything will be okay.

1238
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,250
Gentlemen, they are married now.

1239
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:56,292
Now you can come and bless
the couple in any way you wish.

1240
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:58,792
-Congratulations...
-Congratulations.

1241
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,250
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1242
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:02,667
Hello.

1243
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,500
Come on, that's all.

1244
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,917
Come on smile now.

1245
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:30,333
Come on, that's it. Let's go...

1246
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,000
Come on.

1247
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,167
Cry. It's your send off. Cry.

1248
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,000
She was like my daughter.

1249
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,000
Uncle, shed some tears.

1250
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,958
My dear daughter...

1251
01:09:58,792 --> 01:10:00,917
Please take care of her.

1252
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,750
Cry...

1253
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,708
Seek their blessings.

1254
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:08,958
Father-in-law.

1255
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:12,500
Take care of our daughter.

1256
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,167
Bless you, dear.

1257
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,708
Don't cry. Don't cry. Let's go.

1258
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,083
Uncle!

1259
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:24,625
Bye.

1260
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,792
Please stop her.

1261
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:29,958
Be quiet.

1262
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,833
Please stop her, Uncle.

1263
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,500
Come, Aunt. Let get some tea.

1264
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:27,208
<i>We are made for each other</i>

1265
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:30,000
<i>I am always with you</i>

1266
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,042
<i>We are made for each other</i>

1267
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,542
<i>I am always with you</i>

1268
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:44,500
<i>Your love has floored me</i>

1269
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:49,000
<i>Your love has floored me</i>

1270
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:53,750
<i>I'm a beauty like</i>
<i>The mountains of Chamba</i>

1271
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:58,583
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1272
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:03,542
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1273
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:08,917
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1274
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,333
<i>My feet look bare</i>

1275
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:42,958
<i>Whenever you go to the town</i>

1276
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,750
<i>I won't ask you for much</i>

1277
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,750
<i>Bring me an anklet, Oh, beloved</i>

1278
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,750
<i>My feet look bare</i>

1279
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,500
<i>Whenever you go to the town</i>

1280
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:00,250
<i>I won't ask you for much</i>

1281
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,708
<i>Bring me an anklet, Oh, beloved</i>

1282
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:07,167
<i>The one that's sold on the streets</i>

1283
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:12,042
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1284
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:17,000
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1285
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:22,667
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1286
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:31,917
Come here.

1287
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,500
Careful.

1288
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,167
Go... Go...

1289
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,250
Tell us in the morning.

1290
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,000
<i>Ankita, it's your turn.</i>

1291
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,958
<i>Ankita, don't cheat. Are your eyes closed?</i>

1292
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:03,792
-Pappu, Rani, Pinki... Let's go.
-One, two, three, four...

1293
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:06,083
You were amazing yesterday, dear.

1294
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:08,583
So were you, Mother-in-law.

1295
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,833
Are you guys ready?

1296
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,375
-You're back early today, son?
-I am coming.

1297
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,042
Yes, Mom. It was a lazy day at work.

1298
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,083
Rashmi, why didn't you go with him?

1299
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,458
You should go to work too.

1300
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:33,125
What's wrong with you, dear?

1301
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:38,708
I've been noticing that you stay pretty
reserved ever since you got here.

1302
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:43,333
-If any of it is our fault, then--
-Not at all. Please don't say that.

1303
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,417
I am absolutely fine.

1304
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,333
Guddu, is something wrong?

1305
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,250
No, Mom. Why do you think so?

1306
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:54,500
We got married in such haste,
so she is just tired.

1307
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:55,417
Yes.

1308
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,542
And our house is so congested
which she's not used to.

1309
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,708
Okay.

1310
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:04,292
But, son, whatever happened,
I am happy with it.

1311
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:10,792
Actually, even I couldn't have
found such a beautiful bride for Guddu.

1312
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,000
Right?

1313
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:13,917
She's one in a million.

1314
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,667
Don't be sad, dear.
Let's forget what happened.

1315
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:26,083
You two are newly married so
learn to enjoy these moments.

1316
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:27,583
These moments will never come back.

1317
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,292
And once you have kids

1318
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:33,000
then you'll hardly get
the opportunity to be a wife again.

1319
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,667
Did I say something wrong?

1320
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,583
-Not at all, I--
-No, she...

1321
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,542
-She can't cook.
-Cooking problem.

1322
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:43,667
Yes.

1323
01:15:44,542 --> 01:15:45,375
Silly girl.

1324
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:49,167
Women are not made
only for cooking and cleaning.

1325
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,125
And why do you have to cook?

1326
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,042
You're from such a nice
family and educated as well.

1327
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:58,542
You should go out. Anyone can cook, dear.

1328
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,292
Absolutely right, ma'am.

1329
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:04,250
In fact, she's much
more educated than him.

1330
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:05,583
-Really?
-Yes.

1331
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:09,167
In fact, she should go
to work and Guddu should cook.

1332
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:10,542
Right?

1333
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:13,833
Yes. At least we'll get some good food.

1334
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,375
So it's decided.

1335
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:19,083
Guddu will cook
and daughter-in-law will go to work.

1336
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:20,500
-Done.
-Fine.

1337
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:22,625
-And we'll sit at home and eat.
-Right.

1338
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:25,000
Come on. Give it to me.

1339
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,583
You people, sit here.
I'll finish my chores.

1340
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,750
-Janki.
-Yes!

1341
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,000
Here you go.

1342
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:38,542
Frankly speaking, it's hard to find
a mother-in-law like her these days.

1343
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:41,708
-Rashmi is very lucky, isn't she?
-I can't do this.

1344
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:46,000
What are we doing?

1345
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:51,958
Your parents have accepted me so easily.

1346
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,333
They treat me like a daughter.

1347
01:16:58,333 --> 01:16:59,625
And what am I doing?

1348
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,333
I've been deceiving them.

1349
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:07,500
This charade...

1350
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:15,708
I never imagined that the weight
of this lie would get unbearable.

1351
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,083
I am so full of guilt.

1352
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:27,083
Technically, we're
still in a live-in relationship.

1353
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:32,167
This will be the first live-in where
the whole family is living together.

1354
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,917
This is not right.

1355
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,375
Do something, Guddu, please.

1356
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,750
We had decided to get married
when we get back here anyway.

1357
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:48,417
So let's get married somewhere secretly.

1358
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,833
And no one will know.

1359
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,458
I cannot live the rest
of my life like this.

1360
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,500
Please do something.

1361
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:10,708
Abbas, listen.

1362
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,375
Remember the temple on the hill

1363
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,375
-the one where we'd reported of weeping
sounds being heard every night.

1364
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,375
-Yes.
-Go there tomorrow.

1365
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,042
Give the priest 1100 rupees and tell him

1366
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,708
that two people will be
coming there to get married.

1367
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:23,625
He'll make all the arrangements.

1368
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:26,125
But he recognizes you.

1369
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:29,125
Don't worry.
Just tell him a different name.

1370
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:30,500
Okay.

1371
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:40,000
One happy family.

1372
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:43,250
Get off.

1373
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,333
What? Don't look at me.

1374
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,250
-Cheeku.
-Yes, Uncle.

1375
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:06,083
-What are you doing here?
-I am hiding here.

1376
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,542
We're playing hide and seek.

1377
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,583
Hide and seek?

1378
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:15,208
Did you hear our conversation?

1379
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,750
-I did, I heard everything.
-What?

1380
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,583
We were just joking, dear.

1381
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:24,458
Aunt, I might be a kid
but I'm not stupid.

1382
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,875
I understood everything,
that you two aren't married

1383
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,042
and you people are making
a fool of everyone.

1384
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,958
And you're going to get married secretly.

1385
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:33,333
Isn't that right, Uncle?

1386
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:43,833
Uncle, I was playing hide and seek
but you got caught red handed.

1387
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,417
Okay, come.

1388
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:47,125
Let go.

1389
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,958
-Cheeku, whose is that?
-It's mine.

1390
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:52,042
Uncle Guddu bought it for me.

1391
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,667
His wedding gift.

1392
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,250
Looks expensive.

1393
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:58,458
-It's worth Rs. 8000, Grandpa.
- Rs. 8000?

1394
01:19:58,583 --> 01:19:59,833
Why did you have to
buy such an expensive one?

1395
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,250
You should've bought something cheaper.

1396
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,083
It's all right.

1397
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,333
He's just a kid.

1398
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:09,250
And he wanted a cycle from a long time
so I thought of buying it for him.

1399
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,375
But he never wanted a cycle.

1400
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:14,708
He wanted a video game.
The one worth 500 rupees.

1401
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,375
Isn't, Cheeku?

1402
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,667
I'll get that too pretty soon, Grandpa.

1403
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:22,583
The one worth Rs. 2500, right, Uncle?

1404
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:38,625
Oh, God! Why on earth
did you bring me here?

1405
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,750
Why? What happened?

1406
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,458
Those guys belong to my father's
political party. They know me.

1407
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:45,875
-Oh, God! Cover your face.
-Yes. Okay.

1408
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,417
-And don't take it off.
-Okay.

1409
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:49,625
-Wait a minute.
-Yes.

1410
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:52,042
If they are your party workers,
I am sure they recognize me too.

1411
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,750
I am your father's son-in-law after all.

1412
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:57,458
Even your parents won't
recognize you in this stupid beard.

1413
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:58,875
What will happen if they see me?

1414
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:01,125
Couldn't you find a different temple?

1415
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,542
Couldn't you find a different father?

1416
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,542
His henchmen are always lurking around.

1417
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,458
There are more than
4000 temples in Vrindavan.

1418
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:07,917
Did you expect me to
check all of them overnight?

1419
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,958
You could've checked this one temple.

1420
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,125
Fine, let's go.

1421
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:14,458
Let's go.

1422
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,750
Where is he?

1423
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:24,125
Priest.

1424
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:27,167
Rahul and Damayanti?

1425
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:30,083
-No. Ranveer and Damayanti.
-No!

1426
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,542
Damayanti.

1427
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:33,458
You're Ranveer and I'm Damayanti!

1428
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,708
Sit...

1429
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,292
Priest.

1430
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,917
Now grace her forehead
with this vermilion.

1431
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,542
She is already married. Look at her.

1432
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,417
She's already married.

1433
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,333
You've made me commit a sin,
you bloody rascal.

1434
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:03,250
Calm down, Priest. That was a mistake.

1435
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:05,042
-She isn't married.
-Yes.

1436
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,083
Ashok... Rajan...

1437
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,042
What's the matter, Priest?

1438
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:13,250
Look what he's making me do!

1439
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:17,500
He made me commit blasphemy by
getting him married to a married woman.

1440
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:20,125
-I am off to take a dip in the river.
-Rascal. What's your name?

1441
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:22,708
-Ranveer...
-Ranveer or Shahid.

1442
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:26,083
-Listen to me, Mister.
-Listen, Mister, I am not married.

1443
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,667
We were just practicing.

1444
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:32,083
Listen, lady, religion is
not something you can toy with.

1445
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:33,833
You should be ashamed!

1446
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:36,833
You're lucky that we don't abuse women.

1447
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:38,625
Now please leave.

1448
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:41,542
Come on.

1449
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,500
Mister, I wasn't trying
to insult the Hindu religion.

1450
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:54,083
Nor the culture of our country.

1451
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:57,208
I love my country and my religion.

1452
01:23:57,375 --> 01:24:00,417
There is no other culture
in this world like ours.

1453
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:08,708
<i>Where golden birds perch on each</i>
<i>And every branch</i>

1454
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:12,083
<i>That's my beloved India!</i>

1455
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:17,667
<i>Long live India!</i>

1456
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:26,792
<i>Brother Vikas, get a good</i>
<i>green colored Benarasi sari</i>

1457
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:29,792
<i>-from your shop and hang yourself.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

1458
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:32,542
<i>Guddu's getting married again</i>
<i>while you're still a bachelor.</i>

1459
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,667
I can't get married once
and he's getting married every week.

1460
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:41,208
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

1461
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:43,042
Here I am, Brother.

1462
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:47,333
Rascal, didn't you feel ashamed?

1463
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,583
I never imagined you'll
turn out to be such a rascal.

1464
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:52,000
Who was that lady?

1465
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,042
And how did you grow a beard overnight?

1466
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,875
Looking at his actions,
he's got to hide his face.

1467
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:58,833
The elder brother's still unmarried

1468
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,833
and the younger one's
walking down the aisle again.

1469
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:03,958
He was trying to marry a married woman.

1470
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:05,792
-A married woman?
-A married woman?

1471
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,583
-With a married woman?
-Let's go.

1472
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,750
A married woman is someone's wife,
someone's pride and honor.

1473
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,458
He was going to ruin someone's life.

1474
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:19,750
Why aren't you saying anything?

1475
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:22,042
Why are you doing this? Why?

1476
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:25,333
Look, first, you got married secretly.
But we didn't say anything.

1477
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:28,375
And now you're getting married again.
What's wrong with you, Guddu?

1478
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,292
-What is all this, son?
-What is all this?

1479
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:35,583
What is all this? I don't get it!

1480
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:39,458
-Speak up or else...
-No! No!

1481
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:41,667
Are you out of your mind?

1482
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,542
Grandma, I'll settle for
that 500 rupees video game.

1483
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,333
Hey! Don't interfere.

1484
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:53,875
Honestly, I pity that poor child.

1485
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,292
I am worried about her.

1486
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,458
I am telling you.

1487
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:03,083
If her father finds out about
his antics, he will kill us.

1488
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,333
The end.

1489
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:08,458
-Mother. Father.
-Look at her.

1490
01:26:08,542 --> 01:26:10,083
How much more are you
going to make us suffer?

1491
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:11,417
He won't learn his lesson like this.

1492
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,542
No...

1493
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:16,083
I apologize, Brother. It was a mistake.

1494
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:18,542
I ate something on the way and now
I am not in my senses.

1495
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:22,125
Just one request.

1496
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,542
You can scold me all you want
but at home.

1497
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:26,667
Don't create a scene here.

1498
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:28,542
The veneration will start
and people will gather.

1499
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:31,125
-Take me home. Please take me home.
-Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1500
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,417
-Come on. Let's take him home.
-We'll beat him once we get home.

1501
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,667
I'll not spare you.

1502
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:39,500
-Let's go home.
-You shut up...

1503
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,708
Quiet.

1504
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,167
-Let's go, Vikas.
-Leave me.

1505
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,083
-We'll beat him.
-Wear your slippers.

1506
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,333
Hail the Lord!

1507
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,917
Why didn't Guddu come?

1508
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:52,375
He's at home,
busy with some important work.

1509
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:55,125
And I am jobless, right?

1510
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,208
No...

1511
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:58,667
Don't stand there like a watchman.

1512
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:01,958
-Sit down.
-Yes.

1513
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:07,458
I was speaking with Rashmi over the phone.

1514
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,500
She sounded very depressed.

1515
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,542
And sad.

1516
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,958
I hope there are no issues.

1517
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:17,583
No...

1518
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,417
Did the couple have a fight?

1519
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,167
No...

1520
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:24,708
I don't pay you to sit around.

1521
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,792
Water the plants. They are drying.

1522
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:36,333
Look, sir, I want to make
one thing pretty clear.

1523
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:41,042
My daughter is my happiness,
she's my world.

1524
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:42,583
Yes, that's true.

1525
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:44,958
And her happiness is your son Guddu.

1526
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:50,708
If Guddu doesn't keep
my daughter happy...

1527
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,208
I will be very sad.

1528
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,708
And there's no way you can survive
in Mathura after making me unhappy.

1529
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:00,833
Understood?

1530
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:05,792
Look. You're a Brahmin and so am I.

1531
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,333
You're nothing when compared to my status.

1532
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,292
So for everyone's sake,
the next time when I meet Rashmi

1533
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:19,167
she should look happy.

1534
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:22,000
And not like you.

1535
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,583
Understood?

1536
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,500
-Shrikant!
-Yes, Uncle. Coming.

1537
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:31,083
-Yes.
-Will you have tea?

1538
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,833
-Get some tea for him.
-Yes.

1539
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,333
Add more sugar to it.

1540
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:41,375
To maintain the sweetness
in our relationship.

1541
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,042
Don't leave without having tea. You too.

1542
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:46,792
Okay.

1543
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,833
Shrikant is a rascal.

1544
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,542
He put eight spoons of sugar in the tea.
I feel my mouth's covered in sugar.

1545
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:01,000
This is an insult,
we are the groom's family.

1546
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:10,792
Look what he's looking at!

1547
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:31,792
Look, son.

1548
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:39,875
I know that men of your age
do have some needs.

1549
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,167
They get bored being served
the same thing over and over again.

1550
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:49,500
And often they want a change in
their palate with different varieties.

1551
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:56,292
And one also feels that there's
no fun in life if there's no variety.

1552
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,833
We do understand.

1553
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:05,250
But it's important to
keep your desire under control.

1554
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:09,208
Who's called an ideal person?

1555
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:13,292
Someone who controls his capricious heart

1556
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,583
and lays the foundation
of a happy married life.

1557
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,792
And he's the one who commands
respect in the society.

1558
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,417
While the rest have no place.

1559
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:22,250
Do you understand?

1560
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:26,458
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

1561
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:29,792
We're the ones who don't
understand what's going on.

1562
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:32,042
Kamla, go inside.

1563
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,917
Why have you been behaving
so lustfully these days?

1564
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:38,375
Were you bitten by a monkey?

1565
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,792
-Lustful?
-Yes.

1566
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,125
Monkey?

1567
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,375
I am not bitten by any monkey.
Nor are my desires out of control, Dad.

1568
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,542
How do I tell you what's
going on in my heart?

1569
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,417
I want to tell the truth to everyone.

1570
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,708
But then Mathura will be on fire.

1571
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:54,625
You'll be in total shock and that
Trivedi will die of a heart attack.

1572
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:55,792
Lustful!

1573
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,542
-What's he saying?
-What's going on in his mind?

1574
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,083
You're so stupid. This is all your fault.

1575
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:11,583
Couldn't you remove the vermilion and
nuptial chain before going to the temple?

1576
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:12,875
If I wear the vermilion,
there is a problem.

1577
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,000
If I don't, that's still a problem.

1578
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:15,333
Do you think I am used to this?

1579
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:16,917
And you gave us all these ideas.

1580
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,917
You sent us to Gwalior
and also arranged the temple.

1581
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,833
I see.

1582
01:31:20,917 --> 01:31:22,792
You wanted a live-in relationship
and you wanted to get married.

1583
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:24,583
I was just helping
you guys out as a friend.

1584
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:28,250
-Otherwise why would I care?
-I see, so it's all my fault?

1585
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,167
Shut up, you two. It's all my fault.

1586
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,333
Happy now?

1587
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,583
My family has stopped talking to me

1588
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:37,542
because they think
I am some lustful pervert

1589
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:38,833
who is trying to marry someone else.

1590
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:40,000
And is cheating on you.

1591
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,542
And father told me how
your father threatened him

1592
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:45,667
saying that his daughter
should always look happy.

1593
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,833
Do I torture you every night?

1594
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:50,167
Why can't you smile while talking
to your father over the phone?

1595
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,500
I am not crazy to keep smiling
all day without any reason.

1596
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,583
And your family reaches wherever we go,
like a mobile network.

1597
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:58,542
If her father has threatened your father,
then what is her fault in this?

1598
01:31:58,625 --> 01:31:59,667
Shut up.

1599
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,833
It was you who said that
we shouldn't stay in a hotel.

1600
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:03,542
Hotels are for after wedding.

1601
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:06,125
This would've never happened
if we were put up in a hotel.

1602
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,958
I see. So it's all my fault now?

1603
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:09,833
Stop it, you two.

1604
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,917
Let's forget what happened
and think about what to do next.

1605
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,333
How do we get married, Guddu?

1606
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:14,542
Always Guddu...

1607
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:16,250
Guddu doesn't know.

1608
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:17,875
In fact, Guddu is so desperate

1609
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:20,125
that he can get married
right here if someone's willing

1610
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:21,292
to recite the wedding hymns.

1611
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:09,083
Actually, I've run out of mobile data.

1612
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:13,083
Can I get the Wi-Fi password?

1613
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,125
Abbas, we don't have Wi-Fi.

1614
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,208
See you then.

1615
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:52,542
By the way, I've another plan.

1616
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:54,292
Look.

1617
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,417
And nothing will go wrong this time.
I swear on God.

1618
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,250
I wonder what's wrong with Guddu.

1619
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:12,792
She's a lovely girl
and I don't know what he is up to.

1620
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:17,708
Come.

1621
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:25,333
No, dear. You don't have to. Let it be.

1622
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:26,625
Go and rest.

1623
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,250
This is not your job.

1624
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:32,292
No, Mother-in-law, I'll do it.

1625
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:36,667
So, dear, all okay?

1626
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,250
Yes?

1627
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:47,250
Mother-in-law, can Guddu and I
visit our family deity's temple.

1628
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:48,667
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

1629
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:52,833
Just... take care of him.

1630
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,792
If you take proper care of him at night

1631
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:58,292
you won't have to worry about him
at other times.

1632
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,000
-She is right, you know.
-Yes.

1633
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:07,625
Men are like a money plant.

1634
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:12,292
They need constant watering as well as
direction.

1635
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:13,958
Otherwise they go out of control.

1636
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:18,417
Keep him entertained.

1637
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:21,250
In fact, give him something
to look forward to every night.

1638
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:25,042
And he'll never look
at any other woman again.

1639
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,500
Every night he'll come
home like an eager beaver.

1640
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,125
Where are you going?

1641
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,875
To the temple.

1642
01:38:40,542 --> 01:38:41,667
Temple?

1643
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:44,250
Again?

1644
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:51,625
No, we're going to Rashmi's
family deity's temple which is close-by.

1645
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:57,958
Deity? Who is their family deity?

1646
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,375
He must be having a name.

1647
01:39:03,042 --> 01:39:06,625
God is known by many names.
But He's still God after all.

1648
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:09,000
Shall we? Father-in-law?

1649
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:12,583
Go on, dear. Come back soon.

1650
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:13,583
Okay.

1651
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,833
And, Rashmi, hold his hand.

1652
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:57,583
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1653
01:39:57,667 --> 01:39:59,708
-Ravan!
-Lord Ram!

1654
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:00,833
Ravan!

1655
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:01,917
-No, Sri Ram.
-Where is Lord Hanuman?

1656
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,542
-Ravan!
-Brother, they are running away.

1657
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:04,917
-How did he get here?
-How do I know?

1658
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,042
They are running. Run faster.

1659
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:11,208
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1660
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:15,125
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1661
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:18,083
<i>Don't let go of</i>
<i>The person who stole your heart</i>

1662
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:20,083
<i>What's your name</i>

1663
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:24,042
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1664
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:33,875
Aunt.

1665
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:50,000
This man has gone astray again.
They are running. Catch them.

1666
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:52,125
They are running. Hurry up.

1667
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:57,917
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1668
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:02,250
<i>Had there been familiarity</i>
<i>Living would've been easy</i>

1669
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:06,625
<i>The night is young and may it not be lost</i>

1670
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,292
<i>The night is young and may it not be lost</i>

1671
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:10,750
<i>It won't be coming back on anybody's call</i>

1672
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:11,833
Wait a second.

1673
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:14,125
Why are we running?

1674
01:41:14,292 --> 01:41:15,292
What?

1675
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:17,042
I mean they don't know anything.

1676
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:18,042
Then why are we running from them?

1677
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:20,917
Yes.

1678
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:24,917
Why are we running from them?
Wait, you rascals.

1679
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:29,000
Brother, they are coming towards us. Run.

1680
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,958
You made me run in this sari.

1681
01:41:31,042 --> 01:41:32,167
Why are we running?

1682
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:33,583
I don't know.
I am running because you're running.

1683
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:34,958
Shut up. Stop.

1684
01:41:39,583 --> 01:41:41,333
-What?
-What?

1685
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:44,500
-What?
-What? That's what we want to know.

1686
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,125
Why are you following us?

1687
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:47,833
We're worried for you, Daughter-in-law.

1688
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:49,875
You don't know that your
husband is characterless.

1689
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,250
This rascal was trying
to marry a married woman.

1690
01:41:53,333 --> 01:41:54,667
You were marrying someone else?

1691
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:57,417
Rashmi, he's talking
about the temple incident.

1692
01:41:58,542 --> 01:41:59,792
Yes, that's fine.

1693
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,083
Don't you have a problem if
your husband marries someone else?

1694
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,750
Chotu, where does one find such girls?

1695
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:07,583
Stop worrying about me.
Why were you following us?

1696
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:10,417
You left home after making an excuse
of your family deity.

1697
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,542
So?

1698
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,042
So what?

1699
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:16,208
So, you'll know whether we're
actually going to the temple

1700
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:18,625
-or not only when you follow us.
-Yes.

1701
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:19,708
Then why are you following us?

1702
01:42:20,542 --> 01:42:22,417
I wasn't following you, I was on my way.

1703
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,417
To where?

1704
01:42:23,667 --> 01:42:24,875
-US
-What?

1705
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:26,542
No. To the clinic.

1706
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:27,500
Yes.

1707
01:42:27,583 --> 01:42:28,792
Why to the clinic?

1708
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:30,083
-Brother is ill.
-Yes.

1709
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:31,833
-What's wrong with him?
-Piles.

1710
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:34,125
Yes? Yes, I do.

1711
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,625
And it's pretty bloody too.

1712
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,250
Then get your piles treated.

1713
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:40,583
Why are you following us?

1714
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:42,542
If I catch you following us again

1715
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:45,208
then I'll run a 30-minute feature
on Mathura Live

1716
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:48,250
that Babulal has bloody piles
and it's contagious.

1717
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:49,667
Now get lost.

1718
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:53,625
Slipper.

1719
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,792
Couldn't you have said something else?

1720
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:04,083
You should be thankful that I said piles.

1721
01:43:04,167 --> 01:43:05,792
Otherwise, I was going to say AIDS.

1722
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,167
Shut up. Hurry up.

1723
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:08,583
-Where to?
-After that woman in a red sari.

1724
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:10,250
-What red sari?
-Come on.

1725
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:12,083
-But...
-Hurry up.

1726
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:20,958
<i>A reputed class of Hindu society,</i>
<i>means Agarwal...</i>

1727
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:21,917
Where were you?

1728
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,583
If you had taken some more time everyone
would've left for their honeymoon. Come.

1729
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,000
Don't ask. Did you register our names?

1730
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:27,167
Yes, I did.

1731
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,250
You just need to sign
and collect your token.

1732
01:43:32,125 --> 01:43:33,958
They are the ones I was telling you about.

1733
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:35,375
What are their names?

1734
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:37,583
Ranbir Agarwal and Damayanti Agarwal.

1735
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:39,458
-Ranbir.
-Yes.

1736
01:43:39,542 --> 01:43:40,833
And I'm Damayanti.

1737
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:47,000
Sign here.

1738
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:50,000
-And their number?
-37.

1739
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,667
Take it. Sign it.

1740
01:43:53,292 --> 01:43:54,292
And listen.

1741
01:43:55,792 --> 01:43:58,458
Put on this headgear so you'll
never have to hide your face again.

1742
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:05,583
<i>Matches are made in heaven.</i>

1743
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:07,417
<i>Yes, matches are made in heaven.</i>

1744
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,000
<i>And today 50 such couples will be made.</i>

1745
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:14,333
<i>And Lord Krishna himself</i>
<i>has preordained this.</i>

1746
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:17,375
<i>So, let's begin this interesting</i>
<i>event with His blessings</i>

1747
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:20,792
<i>which is filled with love,</i>
<i>romance and dreams.</i>

1748
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,417
Even I couldn't recognize you.

1749
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,917
Today we will get you guys married.

1750
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,083
Sit.

1751
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,500
Bride and groom, take your seats.

1752
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:31,208
-<i>Radhe-Radhe.</i> Come, sit.
-<i>Radhe-Radhe.</i>

1753
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,583
-Who is going to perform the rituals?
-I will.

1754
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:35,958
-And who are you?
-I am her brother.

1755
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:39,375
<i>In the name of God,</i>
<i>let's start the rituals.</i>

1756
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:41,792
<i>Everyone, light the lamp</i>

1757
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:43,708
<i>take rice and flowers in your hand.</i>

1758
01:45:02,167 --> 01:45:03,875
<i>Radhe-Radhe.</i>

1759
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:16,875
-Live happy.
-Tell us if you need anything.

1760
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,625
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, how are you?

1761
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:26,333
Hello. I am Vishnu Trivedi.

1762
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:30,833
I would like to congratulate you two for
coming together in this holy matrimony.

1763
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,917
Now you two will come together
in this institution called marriage.

1764
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:37,208
What is your name, son?

1765
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:41,958
He's shy.

1766
01:45:42,042 --> 01:45:43,958
Son, tell uncle your name.

1767
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:48,542
-Ranbir Agarwal.
-Ranbir Agarwal.

1768
01:45:57,042 --> 01:45:59,625
-Son, take off your headgear.
-No!

1769
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:05,917
I can take it off only after the wedding.

1770
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,708
Otherwise it's considered ominous.

1771
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:12,583
And what's your name, dear?

1772
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:19,792
-She won't say.
-Why?

1773
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:22,583
Because she can't speak. She is mute.

1774
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,958
-She's mute?
-Yes, Priest.

1775
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:27,583
Great.

1776
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:31,708
Marrying a girl who can't speak.
You really are lucky, pal.

1777
01:46:31,792 --> 01:46:32,708
Thank you.

1778
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:38,333
Dear, did no one come from your family?

1779
01:46:38,417 --> 01:46:39,833
No one.

1780
01:46:39,917 --> 01:46:41,042
There is someone.

1781
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:42,708
Her brother.

1782
01:46:43,625 --> 01:46:44,833
He was here a minute ago.

1783
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:46,292
He is gone.

1784
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,167
I am telling you he is gone.

1785
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:58,375
Hey, Mister. Mister, come here.

1786
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:00,917
You... Come here.

1787
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,083
You?

1788
01:47:08,792 --> 01:47:09,875
Uncle...

1789
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:11,625
She's your sister?

1790
01:47:11,917 --> 01:47:13,125
She's my little sister.

1791
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:15,708
-Little...
-But you're a Muslim.

1792
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:19,333
Then how can you let
your sister get married here?

1793
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:21,958
It doesn't matter.

1794
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:23,333
He's a Muslim.

1795
01:47:23,417 --> 01:47:26,625
She's not my real sister,
just someone I call my sister.

1796
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:29,042
You call her your sister.
But she can't speak.

1797
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,167
She can't speak?

1798
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:32,417
-Yes, Abbas, your sister can't speak.
-Yes...

1799
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:34,875
If she can't speak,
how does she call you brother?

1800
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:36,875
Well, she uses sign language.

1801
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:39,292
She uses sign language. Show me how.

1802
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,500
Using signs.

1803
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,167
There it goes.

1804
01:47:43,417 --> 01:47:46,125
I know this, Uncle. Hindi.

1805
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:48,500
Nerves.

1806
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:50,750
Handcuffs.

1807
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:53,667
Matchstick.

1808
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:56,792
I will blacken your face.

1809
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:02,542
<i>Rakhi...</i>

1810
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:06,708
-Mr. Trivedi, please.
-Come, Shrikant.

1811
01:48:06,792 --> 01:48:08,083
Okay, Uncle.

1812
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:10,875
I think something's fishy.

1813
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,500
Fine, Uncle, I'll keep an eye.

1814
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:21,458
Why are you staring at me, Priest?

1815
01:48:22,042 --> 01:48:24,292
I am a Muslim, not an alien.

1816
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:26,875
Do your job.

1817
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:33,708
-Mr. Shukla.
<i>-Hello, Uncle, it's Vikas.</i>

1818
01:48:33,792 --> 01:48:34,958
<i>Dad's taking a bath.</i>

1819
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:38,875
Vikas, are Guddu and Rashmi at home?

1820
01:48:38,958 --> 01:48:41,375
<i>No, Uncle. They are visiting</i>
<i>your family deity's temple.</i>

1821
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:43,167
<i>-They've gone for hours now.</i>
-Family deity?

1822
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:48,250
-But we don't have a family deity.
<i>-What?</i>

1823
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:50,417
<i>But that's where they said they are going.</i>

1824
01:48:50,875 --> 01:48:52,625
<i>I have an idea, Uncle,</i>
<i>I'll try calling them.</i>

1825
01:48:52,708 --> 01:48:53,917
Their phones are switched off.

1826
01:48:57,875 --> 01:49:00,042
Vikas, listen to me carefully.

1827
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:02,500
And answer me correctly.

1828
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:07,875
I am attending the Agarwal
Community Mass Marriage Event.

1829
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:14,875
And that rascal Abbas
is getting his mute sister married.

1830
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:20,333
The boy she's marrying is hiding his face.

1831
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,250
But he sounds like Guddu to me.

1832
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:33,583
Father!

1833
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,458
Mother!

1834
01:49:36,792 --> 01:49:38,625
He's getting married again.

1835
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:42,000
Somebody stop Guddu!

1836
01:50:12,667 --> 01:50:15,958
-Go to the mic and say loudly--
-Glory to Goddess?

1837
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,208
Uncle!

1838
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,458
-Understood?
-Yes, Uncle.

1839
01:50:30,083 --> 01:50:32,750
<i>Mr. Guddu Shukla, please come up on stage.</i>

1840
01:50:35,083 --> 01:50:36,292
<i>Uncle!</i>

1841
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:39,708
It's him!

1842
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,583
Shrikant, stop this wedding.

1843
01:50:43,667 --> 01:50:45,667
-Stop all this.
-Stop this charade.

1844
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:50,292
Guddu Shukla, don't you dare move.

1845
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:52,125
The mute girl will stay too.

1846
01:50:52,792 --> 01:50:54,167
Why did you turn around?

1847
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:56,625
Let's go, Guddu, he's coming this way.

1848
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,917
You don't know my father.
He will bury you alive.

1849
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,292
Let's go.

1850
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,333
I knew it.

1851
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:31,000
Son-in-law, weren't you
ashamed of doing such a thing?

1852
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:33,167
-Where is Rashmi?
-Tell me.

1853
01:51:33,958 --> 01:51:39,000
How dare you marry that Muslim's sister
when my daughter has married you.

1854
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:42,625
My name is Vishnu Trivedi.

1855
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,917
I will bury you alive.

1856
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,042
-This man's lost his mind.
-Tell me. Where is my daughter?

1857
01:51:47,125 --> 01:51:50,583
This man's lost his mind.
He's completely lost his mind.

1858
01:51:50,667 --> 01:51:52,708
This is such a cheap thing to do.

1859
01:51:52,792 --> 01:51:56,875
Ma'am, maybe you don't
know that he's already married.

1860
01:51:56,958 --> 01:52:00,417
You knew everything,
then why didn't you tell her?

1861
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,583
What kind of a brother are you?
I will beat you.

1862
01:52:04,167 --> 01:52:05,625
Why don't you tell us where Rashmi is?

1863
01:52:06,917 --> 01:52:07,833
Tell me!

1864
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:09,333
Uncle, he won't speak up.

1865
01:52:09,417 --> 01:52:13,333
Speak up fast otherwise
I'll hit you. Got it?

1866
01:52:20,292 --> 01:52:21,792
What's going on here?

1867
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:24,417
Who are you marrying now?

1868
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,208
Abbas's sister.

1869
01:52:28,958 --> 01:52:31,083
And he knows where my daughter is.

1870
01:52:31,167 --> 01:52:34,542
-But he isn't telling us.
-Where is Rashmi? Tell us!

1871
01:52:34,625 --> 01:52:37,208
And, Abbas, how can she be your sister?

1872
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,542
Your sister is already married. Speak up.

1873
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:41,833
She's like my sister.

1874
01:52:41,917 --> 01:52:43,917
A mute sister.

1875
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,500
What are you doing, son?
Did someone drug you again?

1876
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:50,000
How many times will you get married?

1877
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:52,708
You got married in a month more than
anyone else did in our entire family.

1878
01:52:52,792 --> 01:52:54,458
You're an embarrassment to our family.

1879
01:52:54,542 --> 01:52:56,833
He's a spoilt brat.

1880
01:52:56,917 --> 01:52:58,417
Stop it, all of you.

1881
01:53:01,458 --> 01:53:02,542
I've had enough.

1882
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:06,292
-And if anyone says anything to Guddu--
-She can speak.

1883
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:07,500
I am not mute.

1884
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:19,583
Rashmi?

1885
01:53:20,792 --> 01:53:25,000
-You're marrying your own wife again?
-Wife?

1886
01:53:25,125 --> 01:53:27,833
I am not his wife yet.
You're are not letting me be.

1887
01:53:30,333 --> 01:53:32,208
What on earth is going on, son?

1888
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:34,167
I don't understand.

1889
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:36,917
It's I who don't understand,
Father, as to what's going on.

1890
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:39,542
We've been running
around just to get married.

1891
01:53:39,625 --> 01:53:41,000
But all efforts are going in vain.

1892
01:53:41,375 --> 01:53:44,042
And I am getting beaten up and thrashed.

1893
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:47,042
I am being called rascal,
pervert and a casanova.

1894
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:49,833
Why? Because we wanted to get married.
Because we fell in love.

1895
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,708
That...

1896
01:53:55,083 --> 01:53:57,125
I wanted a live-in relationship
before getting married.

1897
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,042
Live-in relationship?

1898
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:10,708
You two were in a live-in?

1899
01:54:13,458 --> 01:54:14,583
Live-in?

1900
01:54:15,708 --> 01:54:16,833
Yes, live-in.

1901
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:20,208
Just like Nazeem Khan. In a live-in.

1902
01:54:20,292 --> 01:54:23,292
And like many other young couples
in the country. Live-in.

1903
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:29,958
That means you're not married.

1904
01:54:31,583 --> 01:54:33,250
You're still a bachelor.

1905
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:34,792
He's found a new lease of life.

1906
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:36,667
Let's hear them out first.

1907
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:38,125
Stop it, all of you.

1908
01:54:40,792 --> 01:54:41,833
Father...

1909
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:44,208
Forget what happened.

1910
01:54:44,625 --> 01:54:47,000
We were about to seek
your permission to get married.

1911
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:50,125
Please forget it.

1912
01:54:50,208 --> 01:54:52,083
How can we forget it?

1913
01:54:52,542 --> 01:54:55,625
What you did is a sin in our religion.

1914
01:54:55,708 --> 01:54:58,167
-This is not religion.
-Then what is it?

1915
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:59,625
-It's a topic.
-It's a topic.

1916
01:55:02,792 --> 01:55:04,292
For the elections.

1917
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:08,417
And, Mr. Trivedi,
this is not what the youth wants.

1918
01:55:09,292 --> 01:55:12,750
Father, India has the highest
population of youngsters.

1919
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:15,083
More than 700 million.

1920
01:55:15,667 --> 01:55:18,667
Imagine 700 million votes.

1921
01:55:19,208 --> 01:55:21,125
You never thought about it this way...

1922
01:55:21,583 --> 01:55:23,208
which is why you lost
the previous elections.

1923
01:55:23,292 --> 01:55:26,083
By a margin of 2300 votes.
To that new guy.

1924
01:55:26,167 --> 01:55:27,583
Do you understand what's youth icon?

1925
01:55:27,917 --> 01:55:30,000
You lost because the youth was with him.

1926
01:55:30,375 --> 01:55:32,750
The youth who wants to live
on its own terms, Father.

1927
01:55:33,917 --> 01:55:36,000
The youth these days
knows that religion and caste

1928
01:55:36,083 --> 01:55:38,375
are just a topic for the elections.

1929
01:55:38,458 --> 01:55:40,875
And your political party, the Culture
Destruction Party--

1930
01:55:40,958 --> 01:55:42,583
-That's Protection--
-Shut up.

1931
01:55:42,875 --> 01:55:43,875
What protection?

1932
01:55:44,208 --> 01:55:47,375
You protect people by blackening
their faces?

1933
01:55:47,458 --> 01:55:49,375
Can you even spell the word culture?

1934
01:55:50,208 --> 01:55:52,417
The youth these days wants employment.

1935
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,500
-Homes.
-Wide roads.

1936
01:55:54,583 --> 01:55:55,958
And free Wi-Fi.

1937
01:55:56,042 --> 01:55:57,708
Yes, very important.

1938
01:56:06,917 --> 01:56:08,042
That's fine.

1939
01:56:08,625 --> 01:56:12,583
But, Uncle, do we blacken
their faces or not?

1940
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:20,417
Blacken her face?

1941
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:22,708
She's my daughter.

1942
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:24,500
My daughter.

1943
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:29,333
If any harm comes to her,
I get furious.

1944
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:34,708
You tell me.

1945
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:44,667
Does anyone else know that you two
were in a live-in relationship?

1946
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:46,417
-No.
-Not at all.

1947
01:56:48,417 --> 01:56:49,833
-Shrikant.
-Yes, Uncle.

1948
01:56:51,125 --> 01:56:54,875
Tear the posters
we had put up against Nazeem Khan.

1949
01:56:55,583 --> 01:56:57,458
And no more blackening people's faces.

1950
01:56:57,542 --> 01:56:58,833
-But, Uncle--
-Understood?

1951
01:56:58,917 --> 01:56:59,750
Go.

1952
01:56:59,833 --> 01:57:00,875
And listen.

1953
01:57:01,167 --> 01:57:03,250
Please go on stage and restart the <i>mantra</i>.

1954
01:57:03,542 --> 01:57:05,208
Guddu Shukla isn't finished yet.

1955
01:57:10,167 --> 01:57:11,375
Sir, start.

1956
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:13,958
Yes. Everything is fine.

1957
01:57:17,042 --> 01:57:19,458
<i>You and I are made for each other</i>

1958
01:57:19,542 --> 01:57:21,958
<i>I am always with you</i>

1959
01:57:26,417 --> 01:57:29,250
<i>You and I are made for each other</i>

1960
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:31,667
<i>I am always with you</i>

1961
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:36,542
<i>Your love has floored me</i>

1962
01:57:36,625 --> 01:57:41,167
<i>Your love has floored me</i>

1963
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:45,958
<i>I'm a beauty like</i>
<i>The mountains of Chamba</i>

1964
01:57:46,042 --> 01:57:50,708
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1965
01:57:50,792 --> 01:57:56,000
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1966
01:57:56,083 --> 01:58:01,417
<i>Your image dwells in my dreamy eyes</i>

1967
01:58:22,542 --> 01:58:24,417
-Congratulations.
-What's going on?

1968
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,583
Guddu's getting married.

1969
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:28,208
The same boy's getting
married over and over again.

1970
01:58:28,292 --> 01:58:29,750
Despite having two bachelors
in the family...

1971
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:32,000
Well, Pappu's date has expired.
But think about me.

1972
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:33,083
Hey, get lost.

1973
01:58:33,167 --> 01:58:35,958
Sir, I am a big fan. Can I take a selfie?

1974
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:36,917
Come here.

1975
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,750
Is any of the grooms missing?
Can I take his place?

1976
01:58:38,833 --> 01:58:40,583
-Talk to Mr. Shukla.
-He is my brother-in-law.

1977
01:58:40,667 --> 01:58:41,958
Who is he?

1978
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:49,333
Son-in-law, tell me how do I attract
this young generation towards our party.

1979
01:58:54,333 --> 01:58:57,042
SIX MONTHS LATER

1980
01:58:57,125 --> 01:58:58,917
"Don't ask a wise man's caste.

1981
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,375
Ask about his intelligence.

1982
01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:03,625
Value the sword.
Not the scabbard."

1983
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:06,750
-I am Guddu Shukla.
-And I am Rashmi Shukla.

1984
01:59:06,917 --> 01:59:10,417
And I think the sun rose
from the west in Mathura today.

1985
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,292
Because what you're going to see next

1986
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:14,375
is beyond your imagination.

1987
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,125
The Culture Protection Party's
candidate for parliamentary election

1988
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:20,583
Mr. Vishnu Trivedi's election
rally is in progress.

1989
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:23,917
And guess who is campaigning
for his party?

1990
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,125
Who?

1991
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,458
CHUCK THE HATERS OF LOVERS
WE'LL GIVE YOU Wi-Fi, JOBS AND FLYOVERS

1992
02:00:30,333 --> 02:00:32,833
<i>Fair and beautiful</i>
<i>You attitude's mesmerizing</i>

1993
02:00:32,917 --> 02:00:35,167
<i>No one's as good looking as you</i>

1994
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:37,042
<i>You're my soft drink bottle</i>
<i>I am your opener</i>

1995
02:00:37,125 --> 02:00:39,000
<i>I want to gulp you down</i>

1996
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:43,958
<i>You're my bottle of fizz</i>

1997
02:00:44,042 --> 02:00:48,625
<i>You're on fire</i>

1998
02:00:55,708 --> 02:00:58,250
<i>I go the gym, I am lean</i>

1999
02:00:58,333 --> 02:01:01,208
<i>You speak to me like a machine</i>

2000
02:01:01,292 --> 02:01:03,625
<i>You say that you watch Scooby-Dooby Doo</i>

2001
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:05,958
<i>Let it be, don't have to say I love you</i>

2002
02:01:06,042 --> 02:01:09,583
<i>Open the bottle</i>
<i>Let it flow freely in the alleys</i>

2003
02:01:09,667 --> 02:01:12,375
<i>Everyone's gonna say you're coca-cola</i>

2004
02:01:12,458 --> 02:01:15,042
<i>Coca...</i>

2005
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:17,417
<i>Don't mistake me for a bottle of fizz</i>

2006
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,750
<i>I am a bottle of whiskey</i>

2007
02:01:19,833 --> 02:01:24,333
<i>One sip is all you need</i>
<i>To get you high</i>

2008
02:01:24,417 --> 02:01:26,500
<i>There's no tasting</i>
<i>There's no stopping</i>

2009
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:28,500
<i>Just gulp me down in one go</i>

2010
02:01:28,583 --> 02:01:33,083
<i>You're my bottle of fizz</i>

2011
02:01:33,167 --> 02:01:37,958
<i>You're on fire</i>

2012
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:42,500
<i>You're my bottle of fizz</i>

2013
02:01:42,583 --> 02:01:47,333
<i>You're on fire</i>

2014
02:01:57,125 --> 02:02:01,708
<i>Come</i>
<i>Come and quench your thirst</i>

2015
02:02:01,792 --> 02:02:02,958
<i>Come</i>

2016
02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:06,000
<i>Come and drive my tiredness away</i>

2017
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:10,750
<i>You're my bottle of fizz</i>

2018
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:15,458
<i>You're on fire</i>

2019
02:02:15,542 --> 02:02:20,125
<i>You're my bottle of fizz</i>

2020
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:25,500
<i>You're on fire</i>

2021
02:02:47,708 --> 02:02:51,417
<i>Spread this news everywhere</i>

2022
02:02:51,792 --> 02:02:55,125

<i>A boy and a girl...</i>

2026
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:07,292
<i>A boy and a girl...</i>

2027
02:03:07,375 --> 02:03:11,708
<i>A boy and a girl...</i>

2028
02:03:12,583 --> 02:03:15,292
<i>Are deeply in love</i>

2029
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:34,542
<i>I searched everywhere for love</i>

2030
02:03:34,625 --> 02:03:38,542
<i>But once I found you, I was relieved</i>

2031
02:03:41,667 --> 02:03:46,083
<i>I searched everywhere for love</i>

2032
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:49,875
<i>But once I found you, I was relieved</i>

2033
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:53,667
<i>And now that we're together</i>
<i>Let's go far away</i>

2034
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:55,333
<i>I hope we don't...</i>

2035
02:03:55,417 --> 02:03:57,542
<i>I hope we don't...</i>

2036
02:03:57,625 --> 02:04:02,083
<i>I hope we don't...</i>

2037
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,833
<i>Get stuck in this world</i>

2038
02:04:13,083 --> 02:04:16,875
<i>Newspapers are old, baby</i>
<i>Post this news online</i>

2039
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:20,750
<i>I am your sweetheart and you are my muse</i>

2040
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:24,625
<i>Take my credit card and you better choose</i>

2041
02:04:24,708 --> 02:04:28,083
<i>Destination wedding</i>
<i>And honeymoon on a cruise</i>

2042
02:04:28,167 --> 02:04:32,083
<i>These days our love's a hot news</i>

02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:36,208

<i>Yeah!</i>
