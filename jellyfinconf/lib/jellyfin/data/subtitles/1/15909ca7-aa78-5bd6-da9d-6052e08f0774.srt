yikes.

176
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,948
Look at all these baby masks.

177
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,417
Looks like someone's due
for a spanking from papa law.

178
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,618
Nice.

179
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,687
So the van was stolen
from a rental lot

180
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,690
Three weeks ago
and dumped here yesterday.

181
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:35,026
Talk about
a curbside drop-off.

182
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,896
We're working a case here, amy.
It's not<i> showtime at the apollo.</i>

183
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,165
Great point.
Thank you so much, jake.

184
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,835
Well, I'm going to go sign
the van over to forensics.

185
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,173
Hey, listen, I'm a member
of this invite-only speakeasy

186
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,174
Called the keychain.

187
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,844
I'd ask amy also,
but I can only bring one guest.

188
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,080
Nah, it's cool; I'm sure
she's busy tonight anyway.

189
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,681
Taxes are due
in eight months.

190
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,083
Actually, they were due
two weeks ago.

191
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,919
Well,
that is a horrible surprise.

192
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,989
But the point is,
drink sounds good.

193
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,025
[muffled music]

194
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,494
[knocking]

195
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,733
Password?

196
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,435
Tropical.

197
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:24,743
Oh, my gah.

198
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,845
This place is amazing.

199
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,214
Yeah, I come here
after ever case I solve,

200
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,582
Which means I'm here a lot.

201
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,950
Oh, nice.

202
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,552
Every time I solve one,
I go get a steak dinner.

203
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,086
My cholesterol is uh-terrible.

204
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,055
[laughs] milo,
this is my friend jake.

205
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,490
We're working a case together.

206
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,125
(jake)
yeah, and this is
my friend dave.

207
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,793
We're friends.
I'll have a--

208
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,094
Oh no.
You don't order here.

209
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,564
Milo makes you a drink
he knows you'll love,

210
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,698
And then you love it.

211
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,703
Barrel proof bourbon, neat,
orange soda chaser.

212
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,138
Well, to the first
of many hangs.

213
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,673
Yeah, totally.

214
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,975
Listen, the reason
I brought you here is,

215
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,678
I want to ask you,
what's the deal with santiago?

216
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,879
Amy?
Oh, no.

217
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,013
Did she do something weird?

218
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,217
I just want to know if there's
something going on with you two.

219
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,718
You know,
are you together...

220
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,587
Oh, no, no.

221
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,988
Cool,
when this case is over,

222
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,022
I'm gonna ask her out.

223
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,858
Oh.

224
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,827
You're gonna ask out amy
when the case ends.

225
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,863
Perfect.

226
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,498
- Oh.
- [gasps]

227
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,732
Yeah,
that's a sippin' whiskey.

228
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,667
[exhales]

229
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,768
So it is.

230
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,980
Seems about right.

231
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,918
You and majors have too much fun
last night at "the keychain?"

232
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,521
Okay, it's a private bar,
not a haunted motel.

233
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,556
And no,
I did not have a good time.

234
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,224
Turns out he didn't want
to be best bros at all.

235
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,959
He just wanted to know
if I was cool with him

236
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,294
Asking amy out
when the case ended.

237
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,963
No, he dumped her because she
blamed hurricane sandy

238
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,231
On gay marriage.

239
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:57,035
Amy is gonna marry
detective "blotter dynamite."

240
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,103
Why do you even care?

241
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,571
You still like her?

242
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,740
I don't know.
I mean, we're friends.

243
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,875
And things have been
kind of flirty lately.

244
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,044
Plus, we had this weird
romantic moment thing-y

245
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,746
At charles and gina's
parents' wedding.

246
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,548
Ugh,
just say you like her.

247
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,116
All right, fine,
I still like her.

248
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,851
Look, I've been thinking
about asking her out

249
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,252
For the last couple of weeks,
but it's hard.

250
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,087
There's so much buildup now,
you know?

251
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,188
Not really.
I don't ask people out.

252
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,723
I just tell them
where we're going.

253
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,258
Great, well,
it doesn't matter now anyway,

254
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,593
'cause I told dave
to go for it.

255
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,594
That was crazy stupid.

256
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,629
Sorry.
That was normal stupid.

257
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,964
You should have told him
to back off.

258
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,832
I can't go around telling guys
not to ask amy out

259
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,068
Because I like her and I'm too
dumb to do anything about it.

260
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,636
I can't make
a woman's choice for her.

261
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,204
I stand with wendy.
Did I do that right?

262
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,174
Look, if you want to give her
a real choice,

263
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,878
You've got to let her know
that you an option.

264
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,246
I think you know
what you've got to do.

265
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,714
Yeah.

266
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,182
Ask her out before
the case ends, right?

267
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:48,053
The stakes for me are through
the roof for me on this one.

268
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,758
What are these
requisition forms?

269
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,962
We are throwing terry
a "please stay" party.

270
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:00,732
My vision is a frozen yogurt
machine operated by pam grier.

271
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:04,202
Sir, we think sarge is going
to accept copperhead's offer.

272
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,837
I never thought
I'd say these words:

273
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,073
You have to put gina in touch
with pam grier.

274
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,008
No, sergeant jeffords
can make up his mind

275
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,811
Without the influence
of foxy brown or cold yogurt.

276
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:13,878
He is a grown man.

277
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,114
Oh,
I see what's going on here

278
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,049
You're upset that terry
would even consider

279
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:23,254
I'd expect this pettiness from
a spineless amoeba like charles,

280
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,356
But not you, sir.

281
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,724
I'm not spineless.

282
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,725
Come on, charles.

283
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,662
(amy)
ahh, look who's finally here.

284
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,130
We already solved the case
without you.

285
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,398
What?
You did?

286
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,267
Oliver was actually giving us
some pretty bad news.

287
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,869
Carry on, oliver.

288
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,270
So we swabbed the whole van.

289
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,872
We didn't find anything.

290
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,874
No hairs, no fibers, no semen.

291
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,377
And a rental van is usually
a frickin' jackson pollock.

292
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,378
All right.

293
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,679
They also wiped
down the masks

294
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,280
With some sort of
bleach solution.

295
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,116
They were really
covering their tracks.

296
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,751
Check it out.

297
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,252
Well,
that wasn't very helpful.

298
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,888
Although, I did learn I should
never rent a van again.

299
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,957
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second privately?

300
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,892
Sure.
Oh, wait.

301
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,661
This isn't gonna be that thing
where you pretend you got

302
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,928
An important text from holt,

303
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,330
And it's just that video
of screaming sheep.

304
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,099
I promise you it's not,
but I do stand by that prank.

305
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,970
So what's up?

306
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:16,007
Okay, I almost feel
weird saying this,

307
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,276
But I wanted to ask you--

308
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,045
Wow, those pictures
are not helping.

309
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,413
Oh, my god.

310
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,214
They're really gonna
have to re-grout.

311
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,916
Ugh, finding a contractor.

312
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,153
Anyways, the question I wanted
to ask you is--

313
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,988
(oliver)
so I got the results
on that feces.

314
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,091
It's human,
but it's not all human.

315
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,259
You're not dr. Gassner.

316
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,260
We are not.

317
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,394
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

318
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,862
Real quick,
what was the other...

319
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,064
Dog and bear.

320
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,298
Wow.

321
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I thought you'd really
be into that feces puzzle.

322
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:46,004
But I want to talk to you
about something else right now.

323
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,240
- Guys, dispatch called.
- Great, dave's here now.

324
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,009
The check-cashing babies
just struck on flatbush.

325
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,010
We've got to go.

326
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,278
Lead the way.

327
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,013
What did you want
to tell me?

328
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:59,017
Oh, captain holt sent
a very important text.

329
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,118
Oh.

330
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,153
[sheep bleating]

331
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,325
[chuckles]

332
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,227
[sniffs]

333
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,361
What's that smell?

334
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,264
That's lavender.
Terry loves lavender.

335
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,400
A little homemade
honey yogurt

336
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,503
Infused with
lavender and love.

337
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:22,073
Mmm, that is delicious.

338
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,010
This isn't some weird breast
milk or something is it, boyle?

339
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,146
I mean, technically
it's from a sheep's breast.

340
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,381
Hey, terry,
got any new baby pics?

341
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,250
You hate looking at
pictures of my twins.

342
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,785
You said since they
were identical,

343
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,386
I didn't need to take
photos of both.

344
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,288
That doesn't sound
like auntie gina.

345
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,224
I love your baby pics

346
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,160
And your stories about
the twins' sleep schedules.

347
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,029
Okay, I know what
you two are doing.

348
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,498
This is your weird way
of trying

349
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,933
To make me stay
at the nine-nine.

350
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,336
Well, I am loving it.

351
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:55,073
You know, the funny thing is,
cagney naps better,

352
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,509
But at night,
that's lacey's time to shine.

353
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,010
One time,
she went 8-to-8.

354
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,145
- Dang.
- Wow.

355
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,915
(ray)
jeffords, I need you to digitize
all your case files

356
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,951
From 1995 to 1999 inclusive
by tomorrow at 9:00 a.M.

357
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,553
But it's already 1:00.

358
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,555
I told sharon
we'd have dinner tonight.

359
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,524
I was gonna have
a cup of coffee

360
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,393
So that I could stay up
and...Kiss.

361
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,962
I suggest putting that
caffeine towards something

362
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,466
More productive
than "kissing."

363
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,802
Sir,
what are you doing?

364
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,870
Making sure that jeffords'
case files are digitized

365
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,872
By tomorrow at 9:00 a.M.

366
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,275
I thought I was
perfectly clear.

367
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,578
I've got to call my wife,
tell her date night is off.

368
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,148
I sent her all those kiss-face
emojis for no damn reason.

369
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,583
(gina)
oh, no.

370
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,819
Despite what I've been
saying for years,

371
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,421
That ass just might quit.

372
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,357
There's no rhyme or reason
to the locations they hit.

373
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,059
This place was so
well-guarded.

374
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,427
And why not hit the one
down the street

375
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,895
That just has an old man
out front?

376
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,298
It just seems so random.

377
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,901
Yeah, it's like--
oh, that feels great.

378
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,136
I don't think it's random.

379
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,971
These guys are too good,
you know.

380
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,439
We'll crack it.

381
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,941
I'm gonna go grab
some coffee.

382
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,409
Great.

383
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,177
Mm.

384
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,112
Hey, now that it's just us,

385
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,849
There's a thing
I wanted to--

386
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,351
To say a-da-za you.

387
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,254
Why doesn't your mouth work?
Title of our sex tape.

388
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,222
- What?
- Your sex tape.

389
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,523
What?
No.

390
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,427
Look,
here's what I wanted to say.

391
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,329
Oh, no.
I figured it out.

392
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,130
- Huh?
- Here, look.

393
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,433
The trash cans, the van,
the jumpsuit,

394
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,235
They all say
"johnny's janitorial."

395
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,269
Not random.

396
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,171
They cased each location
as cleaners.

397
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,039
No wonder the van
was so spotless.

398
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,174
(dave)
hey, what did I miss?

399
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,575
Jake just solved the case.

400
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,611
Holy crap.
That's awesome.

401
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:40,612
[laughs]

402
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:45,016
I mean, but, you know,
it's not totally done yet.

403
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,517
You know,
still a long way to go.

404
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,653
Tons of paperwork,
and a case is never truly done

405
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:52,557
And the sentence is served
completely to its fruition

406
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,892
In prison.

407
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,426
Jake,
just celebrate.

408
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,328
Okay.

409
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,230
Wow.

410
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,503
That mexican candy
giving you nerve damage again?

411
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,505
Probably,
but who even cares?

412
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,940
Why did I solve the case?

413
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,308
Why couldn't I have just
let those guys continue

414
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,943
To terrorize brooklyn
until I built up the nerve

415
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:12,977
To ask out a girl?

416
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,313
Do not beat yourself up
about that.

417
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,915
I'm not a good cop.
I'm an amazing cop.

418
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,416
And I'll never
forgive myself.

419
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,285
The case is over,
amy and majors are on their way

420
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,386
To the keychain right now.

421
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,387
It's too late.

422
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,621
Has she done
the double tuck yet?

423
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,290
When amy really likes a guy,

424
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,591
She gets nervous
and tucks her hair

425
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,027
Behind both ears
at the same time.

426
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,095
[giggles]

427
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,931
Well,
I can never unsee that,

428
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,432
But no,
she has not done that yet.

429
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,466
Then there's still time.

430
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,702
Get in there
and bust up her date.

431
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,970
Show her you care.

432
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,171
Ruin her night.

433
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,273
You really have
a unique take on love.

434
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,181
Ugh, I've only gotten through
September of 1995.

435
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,349
What are you guys doing here?

436
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,217
Blowing your stupid mind.

437
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,686
We did the rest
of the files for you.

438
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,587
Seriously?

439
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,489
I'm gonna text my wife.

440
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,159
Now there's time for dinner
and a movie.

441
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,094
And none of that
"on demand" crap.

442
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,731
Tonight I'm gonna fall asleep
in a real movie theater.

443
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah, that's how we do it
in the nine-nine.

444
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,601
We got each others' backs.

445
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,636
Damn right.

446
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,072
Charles,
make your own point.

447
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,406
Don't just pile onto mine.

448
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,708
(ray)
gina, where have you been?

449
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,109
You left your cell phone
on your desk,

450
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,512
Mm, I would clearly be
buried with my phone.

451
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:25,483
Sir, these guys already
digitized all my files for me.

452
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,318
- Isn't that amazing?
- What?

453
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,387
Why did you snatch up
sergeant jeffords' task?

454
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,055
Because we're trying
to get him to stay.

455
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,590
Well, that's not
your job.

456
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,292
Jeffords, you can
stay here and digitize

457
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,627
2000 through 2005 inclusive.

458
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,196
I expect it done
by the morning.

459
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,135
Now I have to re-cancel
on sharon.

460
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,205
If I worked at copperhead,
I'd be home by now

461
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,007
Swimming in a pool
of gold coins,

462
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,009
Like my boy,
scrooge mcduck.

463
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,410
[muffled music]

464
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,146
[knocking]

465
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,481
Password?

466
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,182
- Tropical.
- Mm-mm.

467
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,251
That's an old password.

468
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,319
It changes every night.

469
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,056
All right, fine.
Tropical one?

470
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,457
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Augh!

471
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,393
Ahh!

472
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,062
Ha-ha.
Not cool, okay?

473
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,398
Look, just ask milo
the bartender, all right?

474
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,500
He knows me.
Tell him orange soda is back.

475
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,801
I don't know no milo.

476
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,470
The bartenders also change
their names every night.

477
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:23,608
And get out of here until
you know the password, man.

478
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,444
Damn it.
This place is so cool.

479
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Come on, strangers.

480
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,649
Show me your lips.

481
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,184
There you go.

482
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,585
Got it.

483
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,525
[knocking]

484
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,326
Pepper.

485
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,394
Pooper.

486
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,731
[knocking]

487
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,800
Popcorn.

488
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,601
[knocking]

489
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,470
Plor-pa-pa.

490
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,738
Plorp.

491
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,739
Pa-aark.

492
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,174
Parked.

493
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,109
Okay.

494
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,716
Yeah.

495
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,586
Nooorse.

496
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,825
Bull's-eye.

497
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,729
Oh, no,
the double tuck.

498
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,465
[clears throat]

499
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, hey.

500
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,836
You wouldn't kick out a hopeless
romantic who's only here

501
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,270
In the name of love,
would you?

502
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,339
Ooh, you would.

503
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,113
So what happened at breakfast
with gary?

504
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,714
Are you leaving us
for copperhead?

505
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,450
Because I'm prepared to light
charles on fire in protest.

506
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,785
Relax.

507
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,621
I declined the offer,
told them I wasn't interested.

508
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,622
Eat it, gary.

509
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,190
I gave him back
all his swag,

510
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:50,628
Except the puffy vest,
which I, uh, lost.

511
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,138
I'm staying
at the nine-nine!

512
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,806
[cheers and applause]

513
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,908
(ray)
great news, sergeant.

514
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,276
Really?

515
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,745
So you're done trying
to push him out, yoko?

516
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,515
(terry)
whoa, don't give
captain holt a hard time.

517
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,816
He's the reason I'm staying.

518
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,484
I don't know what
you're talking about.

519
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,220
You're an adult, and you came
to your own decision.

520
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,489
Look at me.
I can't keep a straight face.

521
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,458
I played you like a fiddle.

522
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,626
Yeah, you did.

523
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,628
Digitizing those old files
reminded me

524
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,165
Of all the cases I worked and
all the good we do in community.

525
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,201
What's best for my family
is that they grow up with a dad

526
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,536
Who's proud of what he does.

527
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,204
Thank you, captain.

528
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:38,643
You're like the wise old owl
from those lollipop commercials.

529
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,344
Terry's back!

530
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,779
[cheers and applause]

531
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,748
(dave)
hey, buddy, sorry I'm late.

532
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,716
I had to get this dumb medal
from the commissioner

533
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,351
For a double-murder
I solved last year.

534
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,854
I had a pretty crazy
morning myself.

535
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,889
Jake, your taquitos exploded
in the toaster oven.

536
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,258
Thanks, rosa.
10-4. Copy that.

537
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,626
So how did it go
with santiago?

538
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,961
Actually,
she wasn't into it.

539
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:57,962
Swing and a miss.

540
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:58,963
You're kidding.

541
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,298
Yeah, it was really weird.

542
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,632
I've never been
turned down before,

543
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,267
So unexpected.

544
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,370
I'm excited to see
what happens to me next.

545
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,842
So...Blotter dynamite
struck out, huh?

546
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,277
I know, but why?

547
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,946
What does it mean,
and why did she double tuck?

548
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,447
And how come she
turned him down?

549
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,548
Do you think it has
something to do with me?

550
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,549
- Rosa, what is she thinking?
- Jake.

551
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,850
Yeah,
I should ask her myself.

552
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,254
Hey,
you just missed majors.

553
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,956
I've got to say, he was looking
a little bit rough,

554
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,625
Almost like he was up all night
crying or something.

555
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:28,759
Ha-ha, jake.

556
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,228
I'm sure he's fine.

557
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,630
So...
What happened?

558
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,365
Well, I thought
we were getting a drink

559
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,533
To celebrate
closing the case.

560
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,635
But apparently,
he thought it was a date.

561
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,237
Right, and you were
not into that,

562
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,772
Because he's so muscular
and in command of his finances?

563
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:45,509
He's great, but after everything
that happened with teddy

564
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,511
And all the cops I know
who go out and break up

565
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,913
And then still have
to work together,

566
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,448
It's just too messy.

567
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,516
I've got a new rule:
I don't date cops.

568
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,852
Cool. Cool.

569
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,921
Yeah, actually, that's funny.
I have the same rule.

570
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,591
From this point on,
it's strictly dating criminals.

571
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,260
If you break up with them,

572
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,728
You can always send them
to jail forever.

573
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,463
Exactly,
nice and clean.

574
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,598
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

575
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Hey, I got an email
from the commissioner's office

576
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,635
About our case.

577
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,669
What did they say?

578
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,670
[sheep bleating]

579
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,606
Ahh!
Ahh. Ah-ha.

580
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,674
You got me with my thing.

581
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,675
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

582
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,776
Oh!

583
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,453
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
