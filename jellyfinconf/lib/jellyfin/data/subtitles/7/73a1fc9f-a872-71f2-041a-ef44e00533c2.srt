          I will take great care

140
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,747
                  of my godchild
                and my god-wife.

141
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,848
- Oh, yes.

142
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,450
Terry did tell me
that you might be

143
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,651
calling me that.

144
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,851
                          - Aww.
         You guys talk about me?

145
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,587
                       -<i> Sharon!</i>

146
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,588
                          Hello.

147
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,457
- Oh. Raymond.
Hi.

148
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,825
         - Um, Captain,
         I need you to

149
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,727
           sign this
         here and here.

150
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,295
          - Excuse me, everyone.

151
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,429
                  We got to keep
                this area clear.

152
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,598
        If you could all proceed
          in a wall-like fashion

153
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,467
           to the briefing room.

154
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,568
         - Oh, oh, oh--
          - That's it.

155
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,536
      - Also, right here.
    - Human blockade style.

156
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,538
          - And here,
      and here, and here.

157
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,425
                   - Uh, give me
               one second, Gina,

158
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,542
              I just want to say
                   hi to Sharon.

159
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,710
                     Just, um...

160
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,480
        Sharon is gone.

161
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,749
             Gina?

162
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,551
         Is also gone.

163
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,355
                         - Well,
                Sharon is happy,

164
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,691
            and Captain Holt has
           no idea where she is.

165
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,494
          - Damn, we are good at
       stashing pregnant ladies.

166
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,396
            - Guys?

167
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,797
      My water just broke.

168
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,700
    Don't worry about that,
we'll just get you another one.

169
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,502
          Oh, you mean
        your body water!

170
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,536
       That's much worse.

171
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,339
         - Okay, Terry.

172
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,774
          I love you.
        Just hurry back.

173
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,475
    - I love you too, baby.

174
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,411
       Put Jake on, okay?

175
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,445
      - Hey there, Sarge.

176
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,780
     Everything is totally
         under control.

177
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,315
          As you know,
        her water broke

178
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,850
         and she's had
   a couple of contractions.

179
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,384
       And--hey, Sharon,

180
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,686
       how are you doing
           vaginally?

181
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,687
            - What?

182
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,688
      Don't ask her that!
            - Okay.

183
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,823
            <i> - Jake,</i>
       <i> all you have to do</i>

184
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,358
    <i> is keep her comfortable.</i>

185
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,392
         I'm on my way.
      - Okay, sounds good.

186
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,061
    And do you want to just
  meet us at the hospital or--

187
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,729
       both: No hospital!

188
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,863
        - Okay. Got it.
            Got it.

189
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,365
       Cool, cool, cool.
          No hospital.

190
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,099
        I am picking up
  what you're screaming down.

191
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,467
      - We had a terrible
           experience

192
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,702
     when Cagney and Lacey
           were born.

193
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,103
      - Last time we went
        to the hospital,

194
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,805
         they pushed me
      to have a C-section,

195
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,506
   didn't have enough rooms,

196
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,742
    and the anesthesiologist
       was a med student

197
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,911
         who stabbed me
       in the spinal cord

198
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,879
        ten times before
        he got it right!

199
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,915
                          - See?
          Needles in your spine?

200
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,917
                   Childbirth is
                 a horror movie.

201
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,918
     - That is not helping.

202
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,486
            - Jake,
     there's a copy of our

203
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,887
     birth plan on my desk.

204
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,556
        Call the doula.
          - Copy that.

205
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,858
     I will call the doula.

206
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,560
     Which is a thing that
 I definitely know what it is.

207
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,928
      - A doula is someone
        who supports you

208
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,363
          emotionally
         and physically

209
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,397
    and coaches you through
          the process.

210
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,365
          - Oh, I see.

211
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,033
        So sort of like
       a vaginal Gandalf?

212
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,134
    -<i> Stop saying that word!</i>

213
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,753
     - Ooh, that's actually
     a pretty good analogy.

214
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:12,371
    - Well, Sharon liked it,
             Sarge.

215
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,373
  All right, listen, you have
    nothing to worry about.

216
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,374
      I've got it totally
      under control here.

217
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,943
         Love you, bye.
             Great.

218
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,811
        So I'm gonna go
      get your birth plan

219
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,747
        and then summon
          your wizard.

220
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,615
   - Oh, Sharon, I heard you had
                 gone into labor

221
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,816
          in our police station.

222
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,651
        I hope you don't
     contract an infection.

223
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,786
   - Yeah, we all hope that.

224
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:28,954
- Hey, Cap-i-tan,

225
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,155
Could I speak with
you outside

226
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,657
for just one moment?

227
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,426
       - Don't leave me.

228
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,828
      - Listen, you've got
     your plate full today,

229
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,964
         and this whole
   Sharon having a baby thing

230
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,699
    is honestly beneath you.

231
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,467
       - But I know a lot
       about childbirth.

232
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,669
        My ex-boyfriend,
    Frederick was an OB/GYN

233
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,972
       and we would often
      talk about his work.

234
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,508
   Before he started talking
        about it with...

235
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,909
             Dave.

236
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,778
     - Well, you should probably
                know that I also

237
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,713
        have a lot of experience
                with childbirth.

238
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,448
   <i> - And, with a final grunt,</i>

239
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,784
        <i> the mighty rhino</i>
        <i> expels her calf.</i>

240
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,652
             - Ugh!

241
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,889
             Gross!
 Come out of an egg next time.

242
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,590
    - I'm gonna go check in
           on Sharon.

243
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,459
      Make sure she's not
     pushing prematurely--

244
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,627
     fatiguing the uterus.

245
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,464
                   - Okay, wait,
          you can't talk to her!

246
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,466
          Terry doesn't want you
                       in there.

247
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,602
                    You make her
                  uncomfortable.

248
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,870
- I make her
uncomfortable?

249
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,439
                       - [sighs]

250
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,873
- Well, that's ridiculous.

251
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,874
I should go confront her

252
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,875
about this at length.

253
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,876
                     - No, wait!

254
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,011
                  You could, but

255
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,346
              I think that would
         probably stress her out

256
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,680
      and we're trying to
    keep her calm right now.

257
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,014
                So maybe just...

258
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,783
                  Focus on work?

259
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,818
- Of course.

260
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,819
I only want to help.

261
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,520
Whatever's best
for Sharon.

262
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,521
           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

263
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,656
         - You're fine
           with that?

264
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,957
         - Absolutely.
  I don't take it personally.

265
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,959
     I mean, it's about me
 and my behavior, specifically,

266
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,794
         nobody else--
    not Hitchcock or Scully,

267
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,497
      but yeah, I'm fine.

268
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,665
    What a joyous occasion.

269
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,235
- So...

270
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,636
Sharon's water
just broke.

271
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,904
              - Are you kidding?
                       Let's go!

272
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,005
- Hold up.

273
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,775
This guy knows where
our murderer is hiding.

274
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,910
Just give me two minutes
alone with him.

275
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,745
I'll let him know what's
gonna happen to him

276
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,547
if he doesn't cooperate.

277
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,648
[crying]
I'm gonna miss the birth

278
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,250
of my child!

279
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,952
It's a magical moment!

280
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,854
                      - [crying]
                     Okay, okay!

281
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,522
                   I'll tell you
                     everything.

282
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,857
                   Thank you for
              letting me be part

283
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,892
               of this wonderful
                     experience.

284
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,760
- You're a terrible
person,

285
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,762
but you're welcome.

286
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,964
- There you go.

287
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,265
All right.

288
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,700
Safe and sound.

289
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,802
So I spoke with
your doily--

290
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,070
            - Doula.
          - So close.

291
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,505
And, unfortunately,
she is

292
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,572
out of town
for Thanksgiving.

293
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:29,541
            - What?

294
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:29,874
- I also spoke with
your backup doula,

295
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:30,876
who is in town.

296
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:31,877
        - Oh, thank God.

297
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,978
- But is assisting
with another birth.

298
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,078
                          - Ugh!

299
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,881
          Should not have paused
    between those two sentences.

300
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,816
            - Yeah.
     - Jake, where's Terry?

301
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,084
- I don't know,
exactly,

302
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,519
but everything
is okay.

303
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,620
I have familiarized
myself

304
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,288
with the soothing section
of your birth plan,

305
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,756
and I will now
speak in a low,

306
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,625
calming,
Barry White voice.

307
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,859
[imitating Barry White]
Oh, yeah.

308
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,694
Just breathe, baby.

309
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,929
       - You're making me
          more tense.

310
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,564
- Yeah, I get why.

311
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,700
I'm doing a bad,
bad job, girl.

312
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,669
     - How about we put on
      some relaxing music?

313
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,738
    I think that Terry's got
     some CDs on his desk.

314
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,106
- Oh, great.
Hey, Gina, can you grab those?

315
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,974
       - I have made the
       mistake of looking

316
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,976
      at the birthing plan
        and just learned

317
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,878
     what an episiotomy is.

318
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,781
   I'm gonna need 90 minutes.

319
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,650
- Okay.
I'll grab the CDs.

320
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,752
Be right back.

321
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,886
         Oh, hey, sir,
        thank you again

322
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,987
         for letting us
        use your office.

323
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,988
                     - I'm fine.

324
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,989
                     I'm getting
              a lot of work done

325
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:18,990
            here at Gina's desk.

326
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,058
                 It's wonderful.

                   chewing gums.

328
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:22,237
- Okay, well,
I'm just getting

329
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:23,326
some CDs from
Terry's desk

330
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,630
to help relax
Sharon.

331
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,465
              - I don't know why
              you're telling me.

332
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,299
               I'm not involved.

333
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,935
                   You made that
                     very clear.

334
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,739
- All right.

335
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,041
      - Do you work here?
            - I do.

336
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,809
           - My son was arrested
                  six hours ago,

337
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,010
                      and nobody
                     can tell me

338
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,145
          when he's getting out.

339
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,146

426
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,841
                         - Guys.
                What's going on?

427
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:06,925
              I thought you were
           gonna clear the room?

428
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,093
   - They won't listen to us.

429
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,160
                  They're hungry
                      and pissed

430
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,495
         and they all hate cops.

431
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:12,297
       - Would you guys just fix
          the paperwork problem?

432
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,099
         I'll take care of this.

433
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,233
            Excuse me, everyone.

434
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,835
             Everyone, I'm gonna
                    need you all

435
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,936
              to clear the room.

436
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,004
            This woman is having
           vaginal contractions.

437
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,139
          - It's just
        "contractions,"

438
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,774
     you don't have to add
        "vaginal" to it.

439
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,209
                    - Oh, sorry.
            This woman is having

440
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,044
                     non-vaginal
                   contractions.

441
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,212
           Everyone out, please.

    - Thank you. Thank you.

[pained groaning]

446
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,185
            - All right, Sharon.

447
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,186
         Things are about to get

448
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,187
              very calm in here,
                      all right?

449
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,188
                     Look at me.

450
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,223
                 You're gonna be
                     so relaxed,

451
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,524
               that baby's gonna
                   pop right out

452
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,792
                 onto the floor,
          you won't even notice.

453
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,127
- Don't let my baby
touch the floor!

454
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,795
                 - Right, right!
           Because of the filth.

455
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,964
- Where is Terry?

456
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,065
                 - I don't know.

          straight to voicemail.

458
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:49,768
              Maybe we should go
                to the hospital.

459
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,069
- [screaming]
No hospital!

460
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,838
                         - Yeah,
              no hospital, baby.

461
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,341
           I will be right back.

462
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,042
                            Sir?

463
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,544
               I need your help.

464
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,112
- I knew this moment
would come,

465
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,947
and I will be
the bigger man.

466
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,982
I'd be happy to help.

467
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:05,817
                        - Great.

468
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,083
                We need a doctor
               here immediately.

469
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,252
                  We have to get
              your ex-boyfriend.

470
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,953

00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,121
Things did not
end well

472
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,356
between Frederick
and me.

473
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,957
        - Ooh, why not?

474
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,958
        Dish, sir, dish.

475
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,959
                     - Gina, no.

476
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,994
                 I can't believe
                I'm saying this,

477
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,228
                   but we simply
                 don't have time

478
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,030
     to hear about the captain's
           sordid romantic past.

479
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,565
    - What have you become?

480
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,834
                     - A hero in
               a time of crisis.

481
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,202
                   You stay here
        and take care of Sharon.

482
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,570
             - Ugh.

483
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,728
  What if she's still pregnant
      when I get in there?

484
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:28,917
                   - Then you'll
                   deal with it.

485
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,106
         Sir, we're going to get
            Frederick right now.

486
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,242
                   I'm sure he's
                   over whatever

487
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,911

        Run, Terry, run!

00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,122
       Think of your wife

00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,090

             pretend to be dead?

the duck, Frederick?

00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,384
Years ago,
when we moved in together,

548

an antique duck

          And with it,

         - Oh, please.

554
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,229
     We had other problems.

555
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,032
          Or have you
       forgotten about...

556
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,033
             Dave?

557
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,701
          - Dave and I
         were coworkers

558
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,069
       and nothing more.

559
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,071
                 - Nothing more.
                          Right?

560
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,372

            everybody's friends.

00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,340
           Let's go help Sharon.

562
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,108
       - I will be happy
         to assist you

563
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,510
    if you will just admit,
            Raymond,

564
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,478
         that you threw
    my decoy in the garbage.

565
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,947
- That will never happen

566
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,114
because it's not true.

567
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,115
Thank you for nothing.

568
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,383
Good day.

569
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,384
                           - Hi.

570
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,586
                  Would you mind
             just standing there

571
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,487
        with your glorious beard
                 for one moment?

572
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,122
             I'll be right back.

573
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,090
What the hell?

574
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,325
Just tell him what
he wants to hear.

575
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,326
               - But it's a lie.

576
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,194
- I don't give
a crap, sir.

577
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,263
Sharon needs a doctor,
so get over yourself.

578
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,065
Tell him you threw
away his stupid duck,

579
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,366
then give him 20 bucks
to buy a new one.

580
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,201
                 - It cost $740.

581
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:12,704
- What?

582
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,404
That is an insane price
for a duck!

583
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,104
That's way too much!

584
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,007
All right, now I'm angry
about the wrong thing.

585
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,509
Look, just fix
this for Sharon.

586
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,282
- Frederick, the duck
was ugly and gross

587
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,350
and I threw it
in the garbage.

588
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,384
             - Wow.

589
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,385
          Well, I know
       what I'm thankful

590
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,987
     for this Thanksgiving:

591
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,021
           The truth.

     - My phone's ringing!

595
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,128
           Oh--Oh no!
              No!

598
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
       Terry's still not
      answering his phone.

599
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,202
     Why am I the only one
   who cares about this baby?

600
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,037
                    - [laughing]

601
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,006
   - Hey, what took so long?
          Is she okay?

602
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,208
  - Yeah, I was just telling her
          the entire duck story,

603
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,011
         now that it finally has
            a satisfying ending.

604
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,112
          No, everything's fine,

605
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,179
               but I am a little
                       concerned

606
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,081
                  about Sharon's
                 blood pressure.

607
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,050
                     And this is
         a terrible environment.

608
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,151
- I wouldn't call
it terrible.

609
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,486
              - We're surrounded
                   by criminals,

610
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,754
                 there's no bed,

611
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,021
                and you can hear
                 the faint sound

612
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,024
            of someone screaming
          through all the vents.

613
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,125
      - That's Hitchcock.

614
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,227
        His arm's stuck
      in a pneumatic tube.

615
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,029
        It's hilarious.
         - [chuckling]

616
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,196
            - In my professional
                        opinion,

617
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,232
                Sharon should go
                to the hospital.

620
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,503
                          - Hey.

621
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,205
            So the doctor thinks

622
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,074
                    we should go
                to the hospital.

623
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,308
       both: No hospital!

624
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,543
                - Yup, I thought
             you might say that.

625
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,612
               Look, I can't get
                a hold of Terry.

626
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,314
- Ugh, that one
was rough.

627
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,817
Oh, maybe I should
listen to the doctor.

628
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,152
What do you think?

629
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,486
            - Sharon, it doesn't
            matter what I think.

630
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,088
               You and the sarge
                    have a plan.

631
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,423
- Yeah, but the plan
changed, like,

632
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,224
five horrible
things ago.

633
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,459
I'm in a lot of pain.

634
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,828
I mean, I know we said
no hospital, but--

635
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,129
I don't want to
risk anything

636
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,498
by making
a stupid mistake.

637
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,200
Look, you're my
god-husband.

638
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,335
                  - We both know
         that's a fake position.

639
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,304
- Not anymore.

640
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,239
What would you do?

641
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,407
                       - [sighs]

642
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,378
        Where's Sharon?
          - Room 41B.

643
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,679
- Look, I'm sorry.
I know you said--

644
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,114
         - Don't go to
         the hospital!

645
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,482
- I tried calling you,
you didn't pick up.

646
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,084
     - So you decided to do

647
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,153
   the exact opposite of the
     one thing I told you?

648
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,321
- I thought it was the
right thing to do, Terry.

649
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,488
Look, she's in there
with Captain Holt's

650
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,657
ex-boyfriend right now,

651
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,825
but don't worry,
I made him promise

652
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,159
to stop bringing
up the duck.

653
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:16,794
      - What the hell are
       you talking about?

654
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,829
             - I--
        - You know what?

655
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,197
         I'll deal with
           you later.

656
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,215
- Seems like you already
dealt with me.

657
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,232
        I got the gist,
          we're good.

658
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,567
- Peralta,

659
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,503
can I confess
something to you?

660
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,338
I didn't throw Frederick's
duck in the garbage.

661
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,606
      - Yes, I know, sir.

662
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,541
- I didn't throw
the duck in the garbage.

663
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,709
I threw it off a bridge.

         <i> [funky music]</i>

665
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,115
    - Why would you do that?

666
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,117
- Well, Frederick and
I were having problems.

667
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,118
He knew I disliked
the duck

668
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,385
because of
its weak beak,

669
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,154
but he insisted on
displaying it anyway.

670
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,188
I acted out

671
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,324
in a petty manner.

672
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,159
Just as I did today.

673
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,627
I'm sorry that
I wasn't more helpful.

674
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,529
          - It's fine,
         I understand.

675
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,197
      You might find this
        hard to believe,

676
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,334
 but I can be a little childish
       sometimes, myself.

677
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,735
- Yes.

678
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,337
You have gum in your
hair right now.

679
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,205
            - Noted.
             - Hey!

680
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,440
- Hey!
You guys came.

681
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,541
What about all
the paperwork?

682
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,642
      - We got it all in.

683
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,645
    Filed 900 forms by hand
       in under 12 hours.

684
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,147
         It was tough,
         but worth it.

685
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,365
        We wouldn't have
          missed this.

686
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,582
            - Also, we had to go
               to the ER anyway.

687
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,451
             Hitchcock's arm was

692
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,361
         This has to be a record
         for longest childbirth.

693
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,762
         - It's a girl!

     [cheers and applause]

695
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,502

I could help.

                - Boyle, this is
                clearly a moment

707
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,587
           between him and Diaz.

708
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,589
        - Captain Holt,
   you brought me the doctor

709
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,192
      that brought my girl
        into the world.

710
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,693
           And Gina,
 I know you got past your fears

711
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,694
     and helped Sharon out.

712
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,396
     - I'm so happy for you

713
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,797
    and I never want to see
         your daughter

714
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,399
     or remember this day.

715
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,201
  - And Hitchcock and Scully,

716
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,203
      I assume you're here
   for some unrelated injury.

717
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,637
               - That's correct.

718
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,638
            - Jake.

719
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,273
         Can I see you
         for a minute?

720
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,575
- Oh. Yeah.

721
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,411
- It's a girl.

722
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,446
       - Ouch! Worth it.

723
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,348
         - Sharon and I
        wanted you to be

724
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,618
        the first person
          to meet Ava.

725
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,488
           - Oh, wow.

726
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,592
        She's beautiful.

727
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,560
               - I'm sorry I got
                  angry earlier.

728
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,828
             You did a great job
                          today.

729
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,631
                    Hospital was
             the right decision.

730
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,334
              I'm so glad you're
                Ava's godfather.

731
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,736
              I'm so glad you're
           Sharon's god-husband.

732
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,771
              I'm so glad you're
                    my god-wife.

733
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,441
             I have no idea what
       I'm saying at this point.

734
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,277
- Thank you, Jake.

735
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,378
         - You want to hold her?

736
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,713
          - Oh, um...

737
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,615
          Yeah, sure,
        that'd be great.

738
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,101
               - The baby, Jake!

739
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,586
            - Yeah!
Right, right, the normal thing.

740
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:55,619
        - Not a doctor.
             - Shh.
