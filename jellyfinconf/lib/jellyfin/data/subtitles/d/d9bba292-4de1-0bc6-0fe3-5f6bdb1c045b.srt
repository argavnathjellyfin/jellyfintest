1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,202
- All right, ladies,
I don't got a whole lot

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:04,370
of time here,
so what do you say

3
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:06,071
we make like Boyle's mom
and you debrief me?

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,406
- Didn't happen,
and I should know.

5
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,474
She tells me everything.

6
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,708
- Yeah, not everything, Chucky.

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,010
She took off my undies.

8
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,011
Hey, Peralta.

9
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,011
What is that?

10
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,013
- This?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,014
- Oh, nothing.

12
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,715
Just open-and-shut case.

13
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,218
- Well, it looks like
a pretty fat file for a dunker.

14
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,352
What is it?

15
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,455
- Just some old lady
has a missing torso

16
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,490
that we can't find.

17
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,025
- Put it in
the major crimes pile.

18
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,593
- But we've already given them
all of our felonies.

19
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:30,396
- It's because I got a bet going
with the captain of the A4

20
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:33,232
to see whose squad
can solve the most cases.

21
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,067
Winner gets to choose
a tattoo for the loser,

22
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,602
and guess what
I'm getting him.

23
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,136
- Calvin peeing on
the Tasmanian Devil?

24
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,738
- No, it's supposed
to be a bad tattoo.

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,640
Man, you're really stupid
in the morning, aren't you?

26
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,343
- Captain, we all want you
to win that bet,

27
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:48,080
but do you think maybe
we could keep a few real cases?

28
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,715
- Look, I'm gonna keep it
real simple for you.

29
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,483
We only solve
misdemeanors, wieners.

30
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,484
Say it.

31
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,120
all: We only solve
misdemeanors...

32
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,523
Wieners.

33
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,624
- Congratulations.

34
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,192
You just called yourselves
wieners.

35
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,226
Dismissed.

I'm here to discuss

50
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:43,468
the department's new
smuggling task force.

51
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,470

52
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:45,537

vapid PR assignment.

54

- I am.

55
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,475
We need to choose a phrase

56
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,643
to replace the phrase
"task force."

57
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,246
Our research suggests
it's too aggressive.

58
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,247

00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,248
I like it.

60

00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,885
some sort of body spray
for hot dudes.

62
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,854
- Oh, and, um, one more thing.

63
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,556
Since your little stunt
with the subway poster,

64
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,226
I think you could use
some supervision.

65

74
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,678
We can't work real cases.

75
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,779
This is a B and E.

76
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,481

more than that.

77

Look at these photos.

78
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,417
Perp came in through
the back window,

79
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,254
set up the living room
to look like a kid's tea party,

80
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,522
didn't steal anything.

81
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,623
Do you know what this means?

82
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,924
- The victim still
has their stuff?

83
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,326

to take anything...

84
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,861
except lives.

85
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,863
Sorry, I always wanted
to say that.

86
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,632
I think this is the work
of the Oolong Slayer.

87
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,500
- Seems like a stretch.

88
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,403
If this is the Oolong Slayer,
why isn't there a body?

89
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,671
- I don't know,
maybe he got spooked

90
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,640
before the vic got home,
or it could be...

91
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,643
- Jake, you want a case so bad,
you're making one up.

92
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,678
Look, the slayer hasn't
struck in five years.

only misdemeanors, wieners.

literally pick them up

356
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,003
And after all your
so-called detective work,

357
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,272
you didn't even
get the right guy.

358
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,207
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond...

359
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,109
- It was an error, but...
- Do not interrupt me.

360
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,811
Raymond, Raymond,
Raymond, Raymond.

361
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,279
Seven times,
once for every day

362
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,148
your juicy, insubordinate ass
is suspended.

363
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,783
-<i> Same goes for you, Peralta.</i>

364
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,786
Except for the juicy ass part,
because your ass is stupid.

365
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,221
- Now get the hell
out of my office.

366
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,426
- Wait a minute, sir.

367
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,361
You know what.

368
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,464
Screw this.

369
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,433
It's ten days now.

370
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,768
Shouldn't have gone back in.

371
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,840
- I am skraight-up depressed.

372
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,742
Amy's been doing her best
to cheer me up.

373
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,009
She gave me this sticker
this morning

374
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,277
just for waking up.

375
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,413
- Ew, it's like you're
dating your teacher.

376
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,381
- I know. It's so hot.

377
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,283

won't even talk to me.

378
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,284
How is he, by the way?

379
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,519
- Honestly, terrible.

380
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,421
I've only heard from him
once this week,

381
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,389
and that was to tell me
he'd finally come up with

382
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,426
a new, non-threatening
term for task forces.

383
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,894
Ya'll ready for this?

384
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:43,895
Do groups.

385
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,431
- Wow, that sucks tremendously.

386
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,699
Can I have another port?

387
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,966
- You're still
drinking that stuff?

388
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,135
- Yeah, Holt got me
hooked on it.

389
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,536
I even got a bottle
for my house.

390
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,004
It's really classing up
the booze

391
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,774
and take-out menus shelf.

392
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,376
Wait a minute.

393
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,944
I think I just
figured something out.

394
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,429
I got to go.

395
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,913
- Aren't you
forgetting something?

396
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,948
- Uh...

397
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,889
- No, pay your bill.

398
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,824
Damn, who raised you?

399
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,827
- Oh, my God.

400
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,162
You friended the vulture?

401
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,164
- Well, he's not
telling us anything,

402
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,399
so it was the only way
to figure out what he likes.

403
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,534
- Maybe this will help.

404
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,536
He just said his
favorite color is underboob.

405
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,204
Look, Amy,
you're a good detective.

406
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,573
You don't have to perfectly plan
some butthead's birthday party.

407
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,841
- I'm sorry,

408
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,843
but I believe
that hard work pays off.

409
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,378
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?

410
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,013
- No, no, no,
shut up and look.

411
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,080
You're completely right.

412
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,949
Your hard work just paid off.

413
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,051

414

<i>Fantastic Jack</i>
<i>and the Junkyard Rats.</i>

415
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,323

couldn't be any more the worst,

416
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,158
he out-the worsts himself.

417
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,093
[laughs]
- I have an idea.

418
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,496
- I don't know why you insisted
on eating here, Gina.

419
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,531
It seems like
your average greasy spoon.

420
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,966
- Pardon me.

421
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,836
Did one of you order
the hot plate of justice?

422
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,170
- Peralta, what are you
doing here?

423
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,339
- Saving New York City
from a maniacal...

424
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,373
- Um, excuse me?

425
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,842
Are those my eggs?

426
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,543
- You kind of interrupted
an incredible moment,

427
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,412
but here,
take that.

428
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,581
- No, no, we can't
be seen together.

429
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,015
Gina, did you know about this?

430
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,884
- Uh, tricking you was
the only way

431
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,285
I could get you
to talk to him.

432
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,221
Plus, you know
I heart intrigue.

433
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,957
- Sir, take a look
at these photos.

434
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,125
None of the victims had any
alcohol in their apartments.

435
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,393
Not even a dusty bottle.

436
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,561
You want to know why?

437
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,563
Because they were all sober.

438
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,632
They all attended
12-step programs.

439
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,633
None of them the same one,

440
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,401
but they all have
the same leader,

441
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,137
a creep with a record
of torturing animals.

442
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,540
I'm talking dogs.

443
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,141
I found the Oolong Slayer,

444
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,343
and his name is...

445
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,445
- I never do this,
but I kind of ordered rye.

446
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,980
- Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay?

447
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,147
I'm trying to blow
my friend's mind over here.

448
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,316
- Could someone get
this lunatic some rye?

449
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,218
- His name is
James Dylan Borden,

450
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,954
and he works the night shift
at creep-a-palooza--

451
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,956
the mannequin factory
in Red Hook.

452
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:52,957
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

453
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,225
- Are you insane?

454
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,928
We were just suspended
for screwing up this case.

455
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,296
I shouldn't even be talking
to you.

456
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,298
Wuntch can probably
hear us right now.

457
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,167
She has super sonar hearing,

458
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,302
because she's a bat.

459
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,137
- Sir, we're tracking
a serial killer.

460
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,138
There's nothing better.

461
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,139
We're living the dream.

462
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,240
- That's your dream.

463
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,309
Mine was to run the nine-nine,

464
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,913
and that will
never happen again.

465
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,449
Just give the case
to major crimes.

466
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,184
- Wow.

467
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,653
Never thought I'd live
to see Holt side

468
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,122

469
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,290
Mark the day, Gina.

472
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,295
We're well into October.

473
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,562

- Of course.

I'm Terry Jeffords,

480
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,611

my mind to something,

481
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,612

Six, Boyle.

You know, the rest of you

486

could learn a little
something from me.

487
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,324
Sure, sometimes we fall down,

488
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:03,528
but it's how we back up
that matters.

489
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,366
We need to look our failings
in the eye and say,

490
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:12,503
"Not today,
not today, nibs."

I'm not better.

495
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,548
These nibs are just
too damn delicious.

496
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,351
- I don't think the nibs
being too yummy is the problem.

497
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,220
