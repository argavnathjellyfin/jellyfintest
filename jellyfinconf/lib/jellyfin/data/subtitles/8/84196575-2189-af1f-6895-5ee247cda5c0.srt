00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,100
Oh, here she comes.
- Oh, okay.

179
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,668
How do I look?
- You look great.

180
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,104
I've got a good
feeling about this.

181
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,906
- Genevieve,
I know we just met,

182
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,040
and I don't want
to be too forward...

183
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,041
- Charles.

184
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,042
- But sometimes you just get

185
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,043
a feeling about a person....

186
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,256
- Charles.

187
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:47,468
- And I've got
that feeling about you.

188
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:48,680
I like you...
- Charles, look down.

189
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,681
- I think tonight we--

190
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,816
oh, shoot.

191
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,418
- They just gave me
ten years in prison.

192
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
- She didn't say no.

193
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,115
- Hey, buddy.

194
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,699
Got you some of those
fish donuts you like so much

195
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,035
to cheer you up.

196
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,403
Although, full disclosure,

197
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,471
I couldn't find
where they sold them,

198
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,572
so that's just
a chocolate éclair

199
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,024
with lox on it.

200
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,475
- Oh, thanks, Jake,
but I don't need cheering up.

201
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,476
You can eat it yourself.

202
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:18,744
- Nope.

203
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,078
So what, you're not upset
about falling hard

204
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,480
for a lady who was
immediately thrown in jail?

205
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,515
- No, because she's
not actually guilty.

206
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,050
They say she robbed
her own art gallery

207
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,619
for the insurance money,
but that makes no sense.

208
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,521
She would have made more
if the art had sold.

209
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,390
This piece,
"Breastfeeding Knight,"

210
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,458
was worth twice what she got
from the insurance company.

211
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,493
- Wow, look at that.

212
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,861
Not to sound
overly intellectual,

213
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,730
but dem knight boobies
is crazy.

214
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,132
[laughs]
I get art.

215
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,567
- Also, I talked to
Genevieve's lawyer.

216
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,136
He's a total disaster.

217
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,538
I have a couple questions about
a beautiful client of yours,

218
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,123
Genevieve Mirren-Carter.

219
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,707
- She got hit by a tow truck
and sued the driver?

220
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,143
- No, she was accused
of insurance fraud.

221
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,613
- Oh, good, because I blew
that tow truck case.

222
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,615
Straight-up forgot
to go to court.

223
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,616
- Well, they found one of the
stolen paintings at her house.

224
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,085
- But she said she didn't
know how it ended up there.

225
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,586
She's being set up.
- Framed.

226
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,055
Art joke.
Continue.

227
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,523
- My hunch is that it's
a jealous ex-lover.

228
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,726
A girl like that, three dogs,
makes her own turkey stock,

229
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,462
that's the kind of woman
you don't get over.

230
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,497
Look, I know you think
my judgment's clouded

231
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,632
because I like her
a little bit...

232
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,000
- You doodled your
wedding invitation.

233
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,668
- No, that's our
joint tombstone.

234
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,636
- My mistake.

235
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,004
- But as a cop,
I really don't

236
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,772
think that she did it.

237
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,208
Something is off
about the case.

238
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,676
- Okay, Boyle.

239
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,179
I trust your gut.

240
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,547
Let's go free
an innocent woman.

241
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,548
- Nice!

242
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,216
My dreams are coming true.

243
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:35,053
You and me getting
my lady off together.

244
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,122
- I mean, you know
how that sounds, right?

245
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,859
- Look strong but fair.

246
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:41,860
But approachable.

247
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,861
But professional.

248
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,062
And fun.

249
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,130
But not too fun.

250
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,131
This is your job.

251
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,632
Can you handle all that?

252
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,602
- Sir, "fun but not too fun"
was my campaign slogan

253
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,170
when I ran for prom queen.

254
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,638
- Did you win?

255
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,706
- No.

256
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,707
- Ames?

257
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,008
I want to say you look great.

258
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,009
- Thank you.

259
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,977
- You didn't let me finish.

260
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,978
Dot, dot, dot,

261
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,079
for you.

262
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,581
Great news is,
it doesn't matter,

263
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,982
because this campaign,

264
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,051
like three out of five
Backstreet Boys,

265
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,486
is inconsequential.

266
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,553
- That's enough, Gina.

267
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,055
- All I'm saying as a--
if not the--

268
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,492
voice of the streets is,
this tisn't gonna work.

269
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,527
- And all I'm saying as a--
if not the--

270
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,128
boss here is,
if you're not gonna support me,

271
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,129
you can leave.

272
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,130
- Fine.

273
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,198
I will leave.

274
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,100
I'm gonna go get
a mani-pedi,

275
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,903
and I'm gonna do some
serious subtweeting,

276
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,238
so you might want to

277
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,873
[whispering]
keep off the net.

278
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,609
- Diaz.

279
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,743
Look what I found

280
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,912
in Hitchcock and Scully's
trash can:

281
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:34,980
ice cream spoon.

282
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,048
- Son of a bitch.

283
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,254
You hungry, hungry hippos
ate my ice cream.

284
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,523
Why was this in your trash?

285
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,991
- And who throws away a spoon?

286
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,926
It's the easiest
utensil to clean.

287
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,761
- I don't even think
it's ice cream.

288
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,162
It's probably medicine.

289
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,932
You know, I'm on
lots of medicines, Rosa.

290
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,535
I'm sick all over.

291
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,004
- This is ice cream,
and I'm gonna prove it.

292
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,305
- Sarge, no.

293
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,306
It's been in their mouths.

294
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,608
- What am I doing?

295
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,909
- Well, I guess
your little investigation

296
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,176
has hit a dead end.

297
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,846
- I'll be back.

298
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Don't move.

299
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,250
- Not a problem.

300
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,986
I hate moving.

301
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,288
- Let it go.

302
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,923
Let it go.

303
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,242
-<i> Interesting.</i>

304
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:22,560
<i>Yeah, something definitely</i>
<i>doesn't add up.</i>

305
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,597
Did you know there's
a sausage you can drink?

306
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,748
- What?

307
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:27,898
Are you even talking
about the case?

308
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,167
- We got distracted.

309
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,235
She has an amazing tongue.

310
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,704
Strong, supple,
great bud density.

311
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,172
- Okay, I'm gonna
take over the questioning.

312
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,574
- Yeah, I'm
too close to this.

313
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,274
- Disgusting eating habits.

314
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,275
<i>Hi, Genevieve.</i>

315
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,276
<i>I'm just gonna ask you</i>

316
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,178
<i>a couple of questions now,</i>

317
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,079
<i>and Detective Boyle</i>
<i>will just sit there</i>

318
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,348
<i>and keep waving at you,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

319
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,805
<i>Now then,</i>
<i>is there anybody</i>

320
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,261
<i>you can think of</i>
<i>besides yourself</i>

321
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,717
<i>that has access</i>
<i>to the gallery after hours?</i>

322
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,588
-<i> No, just me,</i>
<i>and the vault is</i>

323
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,356
<i>only accessible</i>
<i>through fingerprint ID.</i>

324
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,224
<i>Does Charles</i>
<i>have a girlfriend?</i>

325
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,225
- I just saw her mouth my name.

326
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,327
What did she say?

327
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,661
Is she asking
if I'm circumcised?

328
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,696
- What?
No.

329
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,697
Who asks that?

330
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,365
Stop interrupting.

331
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,366
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

332
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,367
<i>Okay, next question.</i>

333
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,947
<i>Can you think of anyone</i>

334
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:05,526
<i>that might be</i>
<i>trying to set you up?</i>

335
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,105
<i>Maybe an employee</i>
<i>or a rival of some kind?</i>

336
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,840
-<i> Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick.</i>

337
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,709
<i>He's an artist,</i>
<i>a terrible one.</i>

338
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,744
<i>He was always in debt</i>
<i>and begging for money.</i>

339
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,945
<i>That's why we broke up.</i>

340
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,380
<i>Maybe he's resentful.</i>

341
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,648
- Dirtbag ex.

342
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,916
- Oh, that was
my theory, remember?

343
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:18,995
Tell her it was my theory.

344
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:20,073
- Okay.
- Wait, give me a second.

345
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:21,151
I want to look smart
when you say it.

346
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,287
- Okay.

347
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,989
<i>Uh, hey, Genevieve,</i>

348
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,690
<i>Detective Boyle wanted me</i>
<i>to let you know</i>

349
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,391
<i>that he, a college graduate,</i>
<i>had a similar theory</i>

350
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,094
<i>that it could have been</i>
<i>an ex-boyfriend.</i>

351
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,128
-<i> Wow.</i>

352
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,262
<i>He is so smart.</i>

353
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,697
- Wow, it actually worked.

354
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,099
I've got to
hand it to you, buddy

355
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,634
whatever you're putting down,
she is picking up.

356
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,202
- Oh, good.

357
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,769
Oh, one more thing.
-<i> Boyle has another question.</i>

358
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,071
- Tell her
when this is all over,

359
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,373
I'm gonna rub her body
in pâté,

360
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,874
and then rub it off her
with a cornichon.

361
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,942
- I'm just gonna
give the phone back.

362
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,343
- Okay.

363
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,411
<i>Hi.</i>

364
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,715
Guard got nauseous,
so we had to stop.

365
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,916
- Hmm, that's weird.

366
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,051
Do you think it's because
you're the two

367
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,119
most disgusting people
in the universe?

368
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,854
- Could be.
- Yeah, check this out.

369
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,689
Remember the ex-boyfriend
that she mentioned, Nick?

370
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,090
- Call him Mr. Butthead.

371
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,192
- Okay, well,
apparently Mr. Butthead

372
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,293
just bought a brand-new gallery
in Dumbo to showcase his art,

373
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,829
which is weird,
because Genevieve said

374
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,231
he was always in debt.

375
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,401
Looks like somebody just
came into a ton of money.

376
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,935
- Oh, and you think
she's gonna want to

377
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,771
get back together with him
now that he's rich.

378
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,272
Damn it!
- No, Boyle.

379
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,374
He probably got the cash
from selling the stolen art.

380
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,709
Your hunch was right.

381
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,010
- Yeah, it was.

382
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,213
♪ My hunch, my hunch,
my lovely case-y hunch ♪

383
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,314
Come on, Jake,
sing with me.

384
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,315
- That's not gonna happen.

385
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,700
I will literally never--

386
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,084
♪ Whatcha gonna do
with all that hunch ♪

387
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,920
♪ All that hunch
inside your brain ♪

388
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,388
both: ♪ We're gonna solve,
solve, solve this case ♪

389
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,391
♪ Solve this case
right in your face ♪

390
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,959
- We should probably
leave this prison.

391
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,027
- Yep.

392
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,131
- Okay, here's my cover.

393
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,966
My name is Sherwin LeMonde,

394
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,269
sculptor, painter,
full-time barista.

395
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,439
But once I sell my first piece,
part-time barista.

396
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,440
- Oh, nice.

397
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,109
I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.

398
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,711
I wear glasses.

399
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,496
- Is that all you got?

400
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,280
- Sorry, I spent
the cab ride here imagining

401
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,749
me and Genevieve kissing.

402
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,417
- Okay, just let me
do the talking.

403
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,418
- Wine?

404
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,120
- Yes, thank you so much.

405
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,455
Oh, wow,
I love your outfit.

406
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,889
I'm an artist,
so I get that it's

407
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,257
more than just tight.

408
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,159
- Nick likes to
coat women in latex.

409
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,462
He's fascinated by the idea
of the human chrysalis

410
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,896
in society's pupation.

411
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,897
- Hmm, cool.

412
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,299
Human chrysalis
and whatnot.

413
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,367
- Yeah, whatnot.

414
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,368
It's a whatnot.

415
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,504
- Yeah, yeah.

416
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,139
I have no idea
what a chrysalis is,

417
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,140
but serious question:

418
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,141
if she farts in that thing,

419
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,342
does it blow up like a balloon?

420
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,410
- You have to assume
that it would.

421
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,411
- You have to, right?

422
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,479
- Yeah.
- Art is so intense.

423
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,013
- It really is.

424
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,415
Look, there's Nick.

425
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,786
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

426
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,854
- Is this your work?
- Yes.

427
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,422
- It's good.

428
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,989
I haven't talked to anyone here,
but it almost seems like

429
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,525
you're going for
a human chrysalis thing.

430
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,060
- I'm glad you like it.

431
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,796
I wish I could take credit,
but this is society.

432
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,131
I'm just holding up
the mirror.

433
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,299
- Hmm?

434
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,834
Wow.

435
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,169
You meant that literally.

436
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,403
Very cool.

437
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,906
Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist
named Sherwin.

438
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,508
- I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.

439
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,243
I wear glasses.

440
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,244
- So anyway,
I was wondering.

441
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,245
How'd you get your own gallery?

442
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,346
It must be really expensive.

443
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,014
- Art's not about
the money, man.

444
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,048
- Totally.

445
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,785
It's more about
the other things.

446
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,019
- Right on.

447
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,555
- This painting is called
"Genevieve 416."

448
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,556
What's that all about?

449
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,091
- Well, April 16th was the day

450
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,794
my ex, Genevieve, and I
covered ourselves with paint

451
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,929
and made love on that canvas
for 24 hours straight.

452
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,264
- That's pretty pathetic, dude.

453
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,332
You seem pretty obsessed
with Genevieve, huh?

454
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,567
- Excuse me?
- Donald.

455
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,803
- I bet it really hurt
when she dumped you.

456
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,304
- What?
- Donald, your glasses.

457
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,072
- Where were you July 21st,
Mr. Butthead?

458
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,073
- Uh...

459
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,542
[mocking]
- Uh, duh, uh...

460
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,544
you were robbing
Genevieve's gallery.

461
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,578
You framed her,

462
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,213
and I should
arrest you right now.

463
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,314
- What are you, cops?
- What?

464
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,216
No, we're artists.

465
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,185
And as artists,
we question everything,

466
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,887
including certain people's
whereabouts on particular dates.

467
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,888
- Get out of here.

468
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,256
- Fine, but we're taking this,

469
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,825
because you don't
deserve that memory.

470
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,226
- That painting is $95,000.

471
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,227
- I don't want it anyway.

472
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,396
Your penis was on it.

473
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,397
- Sorry about that.

474
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,065
Donald is...

475
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,133
sucks.

476
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,536
- Hey, you dum-dums.

477
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,971
Ice cream.

478
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,240
Moose tracks ice cream.

479
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,508
- How do you know?

480
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,476
- Yep, it's
definitely ice cream.

481
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,029
- Knew it!
- They're going down.

482
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,581
- Also, whoever used this spoon,
their body ain't right.

483
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,183
- Okay, let's say
it is ice cream.

484
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,285
But I didn't eat it;
I couldn't have.

485
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,553
I'm lactose intolerant.

486
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,855
- Me too.

487
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,857
I'm super lactose intolerant.

488
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,858
- You're lying.

489
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,292
- Have you ever
seen us eat dairy?

490
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,628
- You know no one can bear
to watch you eat.

491
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,063
- Check.

492
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,564
- And...

493
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,066
check.

494
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,601
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

495
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,369
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

496
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,104
- I got to say, Boyle.

497
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,505
Nick was pretty defensive.

498
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,641
- Yeah, and he's
a terrible artist.

499
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,576
All he does is
have sex on canvases.

500
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,412
Any fourth grader
could do that.

501
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,548
- But...

502
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,549
they shouldn't.

503
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,516
- No.

504
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,518
- Hey, Nick doesn't like cops,

505
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,953
but he didn't do anything wrong.

506
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,154
- And how would you know?

507
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,990
- I'm his assistant, Dvora.

508
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,291
He would never
set up Genevieve.

509
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,525
He's still in love with her.

510
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,628
He keeps boxes of
her old stuff lying around.

511
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,963
- Ooh, can we look at,
smell, and handle them?

512
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,298
I mean, you know,
for the investigation.

513
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,599
We're cops.

514
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,034
- Please, take the boxes.

515
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,035
I want them out of here.

516
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,370
- Oh, okay, great.

517
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,504
You wouldn't happen
to know where he was

518
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,639
on July 21st, would you?

519
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,458
- Actually, I would.

520
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,276
He did a performance art piece
that entire month.

521
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,611
He lived in a cage on the street
and never left it.

522
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,679
The whole thing's on video.

523
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,147
- Okay, great.

524
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,148
Totally.

525
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,283
We'll just go around back

526
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,617
and pick up the boxes.

527
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,486
Oh, one more thing.

528
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,621
Where in this "cage"
did he go to the bathroom?

529
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,689
- Bucket.
- Okay, gross.

530
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,957
Have a good night.

531
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,228
- Sir, I saw my poster
on the subway this morning.

532
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,629
- Well, you must feel
like a celebrity,

533
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,598
a regular Ira Glass.

534
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,102
- They put a Hitler
mustache on me.

535
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,238
- Yes, this is unfortunate,

536
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,407
but let's not overreact
to one graffito.

537
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,942
- It wasn't just one.

538
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,644
People drew on
every single poster.

539
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,348
They put devil horns,
target on my face,

540
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,717
this one says, "Die Pig,"
and worst of all,

541
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,019
they didn't put the comma
between "Die" and "Pig."

542
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,354
- This is easily dealt with.

543
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,422
I'll just issue
a statement saying

544
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,990
vandals will be prosecuted.

545
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,092
- It's not just vandalism, sir.

546
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,594
People have
real complaints too.

547
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,662
"End stop and frisks.

548
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,197
"Stop racial profiling.

549
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,499
Unlawful arrest is a crime."

550
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,984
- I see.

551
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,468
- I think Gina was right
about the campaign, sir.

552
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,471
- Hmm.

553
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,472
I'm surprised she hasn't marched
in here to say, "I told you so."

554
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,607
- She wouldn't do that.

555
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,710
- You're right, Amy.

556
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,312
For once in your life,
you're 100% right.

557
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,081
I would never say that.

558
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,655
Did you have enough time
to read it all?

559
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,522
- Yes.

560
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,024
- Okay, good.

561
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,726
- Yep, it's true.

562
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,361
He sat in a cage for a month.

563
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,196
- Eww,
the bucket checks out.

564
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,197
- This is insane.

565
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,298
Anything is art.

566
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,883
Here, watch this.

567
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,467
A statue of Jesus
made out of cigarette butts.

568
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,936
Boom, I'm a millionaire.

569
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,403
- That's actually pretty good.
- I know.

570
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,538
And I could
call it "Holy Smokes."

571
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,773
Should we really do this?

572
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,475
No, right?

573
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,176
That's crazy; you can't just
become an artist out of nowhere.

574
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,177
- Jake.
- What?

575
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,412
- The case.
- Yeah.

576
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,546
- So Nick has an alibi;
that's not great.

577
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,015
But we have a box

578
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,483
of Genevieve's stuff
from the gallery.

579
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,318
I'm sure there's something
in here that will exonerate her.

580
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,619
- Right.
- Oh, my God.

581
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,488
Socks and shoes.

582
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,656
This is exactly
the type of stuff I own.

583
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,425
This is kismet.

584
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,193
Oh, no,
what's this?

585
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,561
It's a receipt
for a storage unit

586
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,196
that she didn't
tell anyone about.

587
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,498
- It's probably nothing.
- Yeah.

588
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,532
Yeah, yeah.

589
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,533
I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah.

590
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,667
- It's totally nothing.
- No.

591
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,239
- It's a bunch of
stolen art.

592
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,306
- [sighs]

593
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,478
- Hey, buddy.

594
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,479
Sorry about Genevieve.

595
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,547
- It's okay.

596
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,382
I'm resigned to
my life of solitude.

597
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,317
Just me and my five dogs.

598
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,153
- Wait, I thought
you only had three dogs.

599
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,188
- I just adopted two
online right now.

600
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,423
Oh, this pit bull hates kids.

601
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,590
That's fine;
I'll never have any.

602
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,591
Add to cart.

603
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,495
- Okay, let me just grab that.

604
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,763
Listen to me, Charles.

605
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,081
You're gonna be fine.

606
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,398
There are plenty
of women out there.

607
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,701
Strong, beautiful, smart women.

608
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,702
How about her?

609
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,204
She's very beautiful.

610
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,273
- With my luck,
she's probably a car thief.

611
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,274
- Don't be ridiculous.

612
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,775
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

613
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,077
- Who's the babe?

614
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,279
- Just booked her
for elder abuse.

615
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,180
- Elder abuse,
that's nice.

616
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,498
All right, fine.

617
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,815
We shouldn't be
doing this at a precinct.

618
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,851
- I really thought I was gonna
get Genevieve out of prison.

619
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,053
Then we'd cover
ourselves in paint

620
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,254
and make love for 25 hours,
one more hour than her and Nick.

621
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,774
- Boyle, you would hate that.

622
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,292
Your little hummingbird heart
would explode.

623
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,694
- I wish I didn't have a heart.

624
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,763
I'm off to
the cheese shop...

625
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
And I'm buying by the wheel.

626
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,302
The cheese wheel.
- Yeah, I got it.

627
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,803
- Gina, as you predicted,

628
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,306
there was some backlash
to the poster campaign.

629
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,642
- Yes, I'm the Nostradamus
of your shame.

630
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,211
- I think a problem
the police have had

631
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,180
is our inability
to admit our mistakes,

632
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,250
so this campaign

633
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,453
was, um...

634
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,454
a mistake.

635
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,655
You told me that,

636
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,157
but I got defensive
and didn't listen.

637
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,859
I should have been
open to criticism,

638
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:51,229
as this department should be
open to criticism.

639
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:55,299
That's why I'm
replacing these with...

640
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,172
These.

641
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,540
My email address
is at the bottom,

642
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,276
and I intend to respond
to every message I receive.

643
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,778
Before we put them up,
I want to hear your thoughts.

644
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,280
- I love them.

645
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:13,217
Once again, my advice has,
like, saved the city.

646
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,986
- I came up with the slogan.

647
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,754
- It's tacky to
take credit for stuff.

648
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,224
- We're here to apologize.

649
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,559
I can't prove you took
my moose tracks,

650
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,693
so I shouldn't have
yelled at you.

651
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,861
- I'm impressed.

652
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,396
It takes a big person to admit

653
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,165
when they're being
a total dum-dum.

654
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,466
- We want to
make it up to you.

655
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,667
We got you a pizza.

656
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,670
- Only one pizza
for both of us?

657
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,305
- Oh, my God.

658
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,175
That was an obvious
setup, you morons.

659
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,509
- You're eating cheese.

660
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,645
You're lying about
being lactose intolerant.

661
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,913
- No, we weren't.

662
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,180
Some things are
just delicious enough

663
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,515
to suffer the consequences.

664
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,484
I'm diabetic, but I still
eat sugar out of the bag.

665
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,152
both: Ugh!

666
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,819
- Just admit you took
my moose tracks.

667
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,489
Admit it!

668
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,257
Admit...

669
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,825
It.

670
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,494
- Yeah, we ate it.

671
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,829
And we're eating your pizza.

672
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,967
So who's the moron now?

673
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,969
Ooh, stomach.

674
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:05,970
- Oh, yeah.

675
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:09,440
It's coming.

676
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,441
- They admitted it.

677
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,343
That's a victory, right?

678
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,212
- No, Terry.

679
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,279
There are no winners here.

680
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,280
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

681
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,281
Coming through,
coming through!

682
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,599
Move it!

683
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,916
Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

684
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,355
- Getting in a little late there
this morning, Boyle.

685
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,356
Where you been?

686
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,108
- Cursing out my own shadow

687
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:28,859
for hanging out
with a loser like me.

688
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,194
Also an eye doctor
appointment.

689
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,528
- Well, there's something
in the holding cell

690
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,699
that might cheer you up.

691
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,700
- That's Nick's assistant.

692
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,701
Why is she here?

693
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,203
- After you left last night,

694
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,704
I was thinking about
the 24-hour sex painting,

695
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,906
"Genevieve 416."

696
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,791
Check out the date
on this receipt

697
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,675
from the storage locker
with the stolen art.

698
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,744
- April 16th.

699
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,446
416!
- Exactly.

700
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,480
She couldn't have rented it,

701
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,782
because she was busy
getting busy.

702
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,783
- Oh, good one.

703
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,018
This is fantastic.

704
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,442
I mean, I'm not happy

705
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:56,865
that she was having sex
with another man,

706
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,288
but I'm okay with it
if that's what gets her off.

707
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,540
- Do you seriously
not hear it,

708
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,790
because it almost seems
intentional at this point.

709
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,027
- Why would Dvora
set Genevieve up?

710
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,979
- Because she's
in love with Nick.

711
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,930
She used one of those
latex casts of Genevieve's hand

712
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,277
to get the fingerprints

713
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,622
so she could
break into the gallery.

714
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:10,967
- Wow, I can't believe
you kept working the case

715
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,637
even after I gave up.

716
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,804
That was a nice thing to do.

717
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,841
- Charles, I didn't
do it to be nice.

718
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,943
I did it to be amazing.

719
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,344
And I think you're
a great detective,

720
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,479
and I trusted your gut.

721
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,947
Go get your girlfriend
out of prison.

722
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,716
- Oh, thanks, man.

723
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,484
Next time you see me,
I'm gonna be all out of orgasms.

724
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,686
- No, you can't say that
while you're hugging someone.

725
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,023
