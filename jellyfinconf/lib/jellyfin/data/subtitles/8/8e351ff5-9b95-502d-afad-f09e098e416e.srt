- Hey, Jakey, the place
on the corner

00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,337
is serving lemonade,
and you get to keep the jar.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,538
It's pretty cool.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,508
- Yes, that's very cool, Scully.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,509
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,610
- Will you excuse me
just one moment?

7
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,145
- Oh, sure.

8
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,147
- Guys, guys, guys!

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,282
Scully has a mason jar
full of lemonade.

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,268
- You called us in here
to tell us that?

11
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,253
- No, I called you in here
to change your lives!

12
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,155
For, you see,
a mere five minutes ago,

13
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,156
Hitchcock introduced me

14
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,391
to his new goldfish,
who lives in...

15
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,392
- [gasps]

16
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,426
An identical
mason jar!

17
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,395
- Oh, this isn't
gonna end well.

18
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,030
- There are
two possible outcomes,

19
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,598
and we're going to bet on
which one happens first.

20
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,166
So, will Hitchcock
put fish food

21
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,167
in Scully's lemonade,

22
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,169
or will Scully drink
Hitchcock's goldfish?

23
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,203
Now, you would think that

24
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,505
putting fish food
into lemonade--

25
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,140
- Hitchcock just drank
his own fish.

26
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,141
- What?

27
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:45,511

- Drug dealers have gotten
so creative.

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,780
It used to just be "crack,"
and then they'd be like,

99
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,782
"Hey, we got a new one.
What are we gonna call this?"

100
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,450
And they'd go,
"I don't know, crank?"

101
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,286

following up on.

I mean, Detective Peralta

Peralta and Boyle
can work the case.

we could work
the case together.

112
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,770

finish my sentence.

It's all above board.

117
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,744

That is much too much money.

for Mr. Met to come
to your birthday party.

365
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,895
- Yeah, and it was worth it.

Mr. Met used my bathroom.

That's a memory

are expensive,

369

It's gonna be in your life

- True, but it's also
still just a mattress, you know?

372
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,976
It's a lot of money

- I didn't.

money well spent,

00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,250

00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,388
- All right.
You want to get serious?

527
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,691
How come you haven't told
your mom that we're dating?

528
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,259
Yeah, that's right.

529
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:02,694
I saw the text she sent you
about setting you up

530
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:03,695
with some dude named Gary.

531
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,163
- You read my texts?

532
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,531
- It buzzed when you were
in the bathroom.

533
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,499
Who doesn't bring their phone
with them into the bathroom?

534
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,201
That's, like, the whole reason
to go in there.

535
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,236
- I haven't told her because
I haven't had the chance.

536
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,271
- What?

537
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,306
You talk to her, like,
every week.

538
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,340
You basically stalk her.

539
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,507
Why don't you just admit

540
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,142
that you don't want
to tell her about me?

541
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,445
- Jake, it's not about you.

542
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,214
Look; the minute I tell her
that I'm dating someone,

543
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,649
she's gonna call me
all the time

544
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,185
and ask me a million
annoying questions.

545
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,454
- Wow, it sounds like
such a huge drag.

546
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,456
I guess I'm just not
"worth it."

547
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,857
Boom--used the thing
you said to me

548
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,257
in a different argument
in this argument.

549
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,259
I win the argument.

550
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,728
- Oh, no, no, no.
This is bad.

551
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,463
- Well, you started it...
or I did.

552
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,264
I can't remember at this point.
- No, Jake.

553
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,599
Look at the screen.

554
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,468
- Oh, no.

555
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,605
<i>For the last time,</i>
<i>Orangina is not orange soda.</i>

556
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,440
-<i> Yeah, because it's better.</i>

557
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,510
-<i> Uh, okay, now you're just</i>
<i>being crazy.</i>

558
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,612
-<i> You're not even</i>
<i>taking this--</i>

559
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,481
- You do have to admit,
it was a pretty good point

560
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,749
about Orangina, though.

561
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,323
<i>♪ ♪</i>

562
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,624
- Your turn, Peralta.

563
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,526
- Thank you, Santiago.

564
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,629
Okay.

565
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,400
I know you're mad,
but before you say anything,

566
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,768
yes, we screwed up.

567
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,536
And yes, you warned us.

568
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,772
And yes, I don't know
where I'm going with this.

569
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,607
But I do know this:

570
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,642
I have reached
the end of my sentence.

571
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,612
Oh, my God. Did that work?

572
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,180
- Not at all.
- Oh.

573
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,682
I can't believe
you let a personal argument

574
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,584
derail your investigation.

575
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,186
- I would characterize it more

576
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,188
as a professional
police disagreement.

577
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,556
- I listened to the tape.
- Oh, no.

578
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,558
Yeah, well, then you know
that it was a straight-up

579
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,726
crazy bitch fight.

580
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,795
Look; I know we screwed up
the case, and I'm sorry.

581
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,396
But if it's any consolation,

582
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,732
I think we also screwed up
our relationship.

583
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,333
- Peralta, have a seat.

584
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,302
I believe this might help.

585
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,271
When Kevin and I
first started dating,

586
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,239
he taught at a small
college upstate.

587
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,475
It was two hours away
by train or bus,

588
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,410
but only 30 minutes by car.

589
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,745
- Is this another one
of your riddles?

590
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,547
You rode to work
on his shoulders.

591
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,482
One set of footprints. No?

592
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,817
- No.
- Okay.

593
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,418
- Neither of us owned a car,

594
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,353
and I didn't want to buy one
because that would mean

595
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,755
admitting that
I cared for Kevin.

596
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,357
He had the same fear,
and so visits were rare,

597
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,525
and I was miserable.

598
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,328
Then one spring day,
Kevin showed up at my door

599
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,297
having purchased Gertie.

600
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,333
He took the leap,
and I'm so grateful that he did.

601
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,536
I only regret that I didn't
do it first.

602
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,305
Do you understand?

603
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,340
- Absolutely.

604
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,441
100%.

605
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,509
- The train is your
old mattress.

606
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,643
- Yeah.
- The car is your new mattress.

607
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,644
- I got it.
- Kevin is you.

608
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,779
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Santiago.

609
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,714
- Loud and clear.
100%.

610
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,383
[clangs]

611
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,451
- So I took care of Sam.

612
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,452
- Uh-oh.

613
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,320
That sounds ominous,

614
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,755
like you went
all Ms. Miriam on him.

615
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,290
- I let him off with a warning.

616
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,458
See, thing about Ms. Miriam

617
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,494
is she made me a good dancer,

618
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,863
but she ruined
my childhood.

619
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,432
She was constantly riding me
about my posture

620
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,267
and my technique
and my pink hair.

621
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,468
- Pink hair.
- Never speak of that.

622
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,636
- Copy.

623
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,538
- She's the reason
I quit ballet,

624
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,706
and I sure as hell
don't want Sam

625
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,442
to quit the Big Brother program
'cause of me.

626
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,444
- This is totally

627
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:10,414
how I thought this Ms. Miriam
thing was gonna go.

628
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,284
Another flawless Terry plan.

629
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,685
- Boyle, I thought
you should know.

630
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,554
I just got Gertie back
from the garage.

631
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,422
She looks as good as new.

632
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,790
Better, even,
because after 12 years,

633
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,592
they finally got
the Annie Lennox cassette

634
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,593
out of the tape player.

635
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,895
- Oh, I love her.

636
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,630
Here's a check
for the full amount.

637
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,433
- You don't owe me anything.

638
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,903
It was my fault,
and I behaved poorly,

639
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,539
as Gina made abundantly clear.

640
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,806
- Oh, speaking of,

641
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,709
you still owe me $14
for that cupcake.

642
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

643
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,579
- What's up?

644
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,580
- Two things.

645
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,848
I ran the footage
from the hotel

646
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,350
through facial recognition
software and got a match:

647
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,785
Grady Lamont.

648
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,687
This is his current address.

649
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,688
- That's good, I guess.

650
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,889
- Yeah, it's six years old.

651
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,925
- Well, druggies are lazy?

652
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,359
- He deals in uppers.

653
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,460
- We're screwed.
- Yup.

654
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,429
- What's the second thing?

655
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,897
- Well, the Captain and I
were jamming

656
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,600
on some personal issues,
just going back and forth.

657
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,336
I honestly think I helped him
more than he helped me.

658
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,837
- I'm not buying any of that.
- No.

659
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,374
[sighs]

660
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,476
Amy Santiago...

661
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,911
I want to change mattresses
for you.

662
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,481
- That's the best thing
I've ever heard.

663
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,350
- I'm sorry I didn't
do it sooner.

664
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,353
I think I was just scared
that you were gonna realize

665
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,688
you're way better than me.

666
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,358
Like, you're Orangina,
and I'm orange soda.

667
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,492
- Are you kidding?

668
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,660
You're Orangina.

669
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,661
- Ugh.

670
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,762
Don't say that.

671
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,598
- Look.

672
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,633
I was scared too.

673
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,834
I'm gonna call my mom tonight.

674
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,505
- Okay.

675
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,507
Let's buy this baby.

676
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,643
Calling up the website,

677
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,511
finding the mattress,

678
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,980
adding to cart,

679
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,648
signing in as "guest"...

680
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,483
That is not an option.

681
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,784
Creating an account...

682
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,620
- You don't have to buy it
right this second.

683
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,388
- Nope, this is a big
romantic gesture,

684
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,589
and I'm nailing it.

685
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,392
Shipping address--
not the same as billing address.

686
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,793
Got to enter both of those.

687
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,695
- Jake, Jake, look!
There's our guy.

688
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,930
- Oh, perfect timing.

689
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:06,998
Submit order.

690
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,499
Province? Oh, no.

691
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,600
We're on the Canadian website.

692
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,701
Click on the American flag.

693
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,736
- Jake!
- Yeah.

694
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:12,770
We'll do this later.
Let's go!

695
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,472
-<i> Not a doctor. Shh!</i>
