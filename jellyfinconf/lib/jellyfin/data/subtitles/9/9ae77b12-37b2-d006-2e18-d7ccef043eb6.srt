I could stay in these
bad boys all day.

174
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,484
So two members
of the Fulton Street Four

175
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,486
have been murdered--
sounds like a big case.

176
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,454
No, it's actually
the opposite.

177
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,590
Pretty much
an NBT sitch.

178
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,024
No big thang.

179
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,927
The word is "thing,"
and the thing is big.

180
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,563
We believe someone is after
the missing $21 million,

181
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,966
and solving this murder
could lead us to the money.

182
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,402
Sure, but that money's,
like, 25 years old.

183
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,803
It's probably not
even good anymore.

184
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,072
[grunts]
Sorry. Cramped up.

185
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,808
This is a very
important case, Raymond,

186
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,077
to me, and to the city
of New York.

187
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,413
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine
has the resources

188
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,947
to deal with something
of this magnitude.

189
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,816
I understand
the politics.

190
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,651
This is a
high-profile case.

191
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,453
Do what you must.

192
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,054
What I was going
to say is,

193
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,923
since you don't have
the resources,

194
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,158
I'll give you
anything you need.

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,926
The case is yours.
You have my full support.

196
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,496
He meant that more excited.
Like, "What!"

197
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,171
My hunch--one of them
is killing off his co-scums

198
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,906
so he can keep the money
for his scum-self.

199
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,474
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.

200
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,576
He listed a Brooklyn address
with his parole officer.

201
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,944
We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

202
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,547
then we're gonna have
the son of a bitch.

203
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,081
Either way, this case
is gonna be awesome.

204
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,918
Peralta, I'm putting myself
on this investigation with you.

205
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,686
- What? Why?
- Wuntch is up to something.

206
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,955
There's only one reason why
she would let us keep this case.

207
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,858
"That's the guy I want
flying my chopper."

208
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,992
You know how
to fly a chopper?

209
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,194
How hard could it be?

210
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,764
She let us keep this case
because she wants us to fail.

211
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,699
I'm coming along
so that you don't waste

212
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,935
time and resources
turning this investigation

213
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,636
into another
Ron McClane movie.

214
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,805
Oh, you know
it's John McClane.

215
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,208
I've made my decision.
End of discussion.

216
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,079
I signed out that drug dealer's
Lamborghini from the impound.

217
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,180
It only has two seats.

218
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,815
I saw that you had made
that request.

219
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,650
I changed it
to a sensible sedan.

220
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,118
Okay, but the sunroof
stays open.

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,253
There is no
sunroof.

222
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,522
Why did you even
become a cop?

223
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,824
Oh, great job, kids.

224
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,993
Don't solve too many crimes
and put me out of business.

225
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,162
Terry's got to pay the rent.
[laughs]

226
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,600
Dr. Susman wants
a private chat with me.

227
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,668
Thanks for warming her up,
Santiago.

228
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,970
They didn't give
eighth grade Amy

229
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,572
the key to the teacher's lounge
just for nothing.

230
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,708
I stocked their fridge
and cleaned up after them.

231
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,110
Great. So can you take over
with the kids for a minute?

232
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,645
They're done
with this activity.

233
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,915
Of course.
I am amazing with kids.

234
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,284
[laughs nervously]
Okay.

235
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,554
I haven't listened to rap music
in three years.

236
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,222
I don't know the lingo.
You have to do this.

237
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,658
I can't--McKenzie is
in the bathroom right now

238
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,561
freaking out because Kelsey S.
made out with Hayes

239
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,097
even though she knows
Brianna's into him.

240
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,232
So unless you want
the spring dance

241
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,201
to be a total
drama fest,

242
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,103
I have to be there
for her.

243
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,839
Honestly, you should show them
a picture of a dead body.

244
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,676
No! Rosa, Terry said
to keep it kid-friendly.

245
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,579
Okay, I'll just show them
the stuff that I was into

246
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,647
when I was their age.

247
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,248
- I'm done.
- What do we do now?

248
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,684
- What's next?
- Hello, friends.

249
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,853
Who here would like to see
a presentation

250
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,987
about crime statistics

251
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,723
as a function
of demographics and time?

252
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,895
Who wants to see
a picture of a dead body?

253
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,297
(all)
Me!

254
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,801
Bludsoe lives at the end
of his hall.

255
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,304
Hmm--I would have preferred
an abandoned lighthouse

256
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,572
or a dilapidated barn,

257
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,873
but I can embellish
in my memoirs.

258
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,207
Oh, I can't wait
to read that book.

259
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,842
What are you gonna
call it?

260
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,644
[in gravelly voice]
"Go Ahead, Jake My Day."

261
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,114
No, yours is much better.

262
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,916
"Case Closed, Jake Open."

263
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,051
- Wow.
- I know.

264
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,319
I said yours was better.

265
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,920
Whatever.
Let's just do this.

266
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,192
[pounding]

267
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,927
NYPD. Open up.

268
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,598
[clock clicking open]

269
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,035
Hey, check it out.

270
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,236
(Jake)
Half-packed suitcase.

271
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,838
Looks like Bludsoe
was planning a trip

272
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,239
until he got
interrupted by someone.

273
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,908
- Or something.
- Like what?

274
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,710
I don't know--I just thought
it would help the intrigue.

275
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:12,777
It did.

276
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,146
Come on, how many people
have to get killed

277
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,650
You do know it's our job
to stop the killing, right?

278
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,251
Wait a second.
[sniffs]

279
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,853
I think I smell
a dead body.

280
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,288
[sniffs]

281
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,224
[clears throat]
Nope. My mistake.

282
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,726
Wait! Don't close that.

283
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,127
(Jake)
Look. Handprint.

284
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,396
That's a fake wall.

285
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,831
NYPD.

286
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,866
Come out with your hands
on your head.

287
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,635
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

288
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,036
He's trying
to kill me.

289
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,405
So I guess, if I had
to sum them up,

290
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,273
Cagney is
the intellectual one,

291
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:46,945
whereas Lacey is more
of your traditional prodigy.

292
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,314
Well, your daughters
sound great.

293
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,183
You know, I'm gonna look over
their applications again.

294
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,752
Oh, no, that's not
necessary.

295
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,422
But what really matters
is that your students

296
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,691
have an amazing
experience here today.

297
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,260
They are.

298
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,262
Look, Rosa.
Sarge is here.

299
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,363
Oh, my God.

300
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,399
[shrieking horror music]

301
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,234
Children, get out
of this room immediately.

302
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,170
(whispering angrily)
What the hell, guys?

303
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,204
They're 12 years old.

304
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,372
I would've killed
to have seen

305
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,440
a bag of hands
at that age.

306
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,908
I'm so sorry--
I tired to be myself

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,745
- Where were you?
- Saving the day.

308
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,247
Hayes is out
of the picture.

309
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,283
The McKenzie/Kelsey S.
beef is squashed,

310
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,252
and Brianna's going
to the dance with Aidan,

311
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,788
who's a much better match
for her anyway, BT-dubs.

312
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,956
How does any of that help me?

313
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,426
- Dr. Susman--
- Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.

314
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,227
I think this experience
has been

315
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,729
more than enough
for the children.

316
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,130
We're done here.

317
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,132
I was walking home
from the coffee shop.

318
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,967
I have a job
bussing tables there.

319
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,269
Anyway, the next thing
I know,

320
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,137
Mikey D has a gun
in my back.

321
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,706
Michael D'Angelo,
the other member

322
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,809
Yes, believe it or not,
I familiarized myself

323
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,410
with the names
of all two suspects

324
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,813
in this high-profile homicide
we're investigating.

325
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,015
I fought him off,
but he got my key.

326
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,149
What's the key for?

327
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,384
Each of us had one,

328
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,453
and you needed all four
to open the safe.

329
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,221
And what's
in the safe?

330
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,856
The $21 million.

331
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,957
Bing--pot--

332
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,125
Nope--I was gonna say bingo,

333
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,729
but then it was too late;
I was halfway through the word.

334
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,397
Bingpot works.
It's taking off.

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,232
It's taking off.

336
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,435
Captain, D'Angelo
has a place upstate.

337
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,738
The local sheriff says there's
a car in the driveway right now.

338
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,474
Okay, they're gonna have to
raid the place without us.

339
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,875
It'll take us two hours
to get up there.

340
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:24,876
Or we could take--

341
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,044
We are not taking

00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,356
He has no family.

516
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,292
or someone he worked with
at the coffee shop.

517
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,627
The coffee shop--
why would someone

518
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,629
who knows they have
$21 million coming

519
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,297
take a minimum wage job?

520
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,633
Because he needed
access to that building.

521
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,368
Because that's where
the money's hidden.

522
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,503
All right, we got
to get there quick.

523
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,837
Maybe we should
take the chopper.

524
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,273
[gasps]
You said chopper.

525
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,509
Death Blade,
Sidewinder,

526
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,810
it's go time!

527
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,211
Roger that, Wet Blanket.

528
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,747
No, from now on,
call me...

529
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,351
Velvet Thunder.

530
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,453
Okay.

531
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,724
Hey, Cagney and Lacey
got off the wait list.

532
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,526
Thank you, guys,
for helping me.

533
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,461
Rosa, I should've
listened to you.

534
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,762
Yeah, everyone should
listen to me

535
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,164
all the time
about everything.

536
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,332
It was pretty fun.
The kids actually liked me.

537
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,700
I wish I could go back
to middle school

538
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,701
knowing what I know now.

539
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,770
I'd be so cool.

540
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,739
And I'd get to retake
all the tests.

541
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,474
And update
some book reports.

542
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,777
Oh, un, Gina,
Dr. Susman said

543
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,779
you had a real impact
on those kids.

544
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,714
Apparently,
you were just named

545
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,550
Spring Dance Princess
somehow.

546
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,219
Mm-hmm, what am I
always telling you guys?

547
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm royalty.

548
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,322
(whispering)
All right, listen up.

549
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,890
We go in strong
and we go in fast.

550
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,592
Evans, you're on
door breach.

551
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,860
Patterson--
flashbang.

552
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,895
Boyle, stop squatting
like that.

553
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,363
Sorry, I thought
it looked cool.

554
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,831
- It didn't.
- On the count of three.

555
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,968
[bangs]
- It's Bludsoe!

556
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
- NYPD!
- Go, go, go!

557
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,505
Facedown,
flat on the ground!

558
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,340
[men shouting]
- Hey, over here, over here.

559
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,375
[policeman shouting]

560
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,510
[door creaking]

561
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,680
Bingpot!

562
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,283
[cameras clicking]

563
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,585
This rules.

564
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,486
Did you know that my dream
has always been to have

565
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,488
my picture taken with a mountain
of recovered cash?

566
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,623
And it's always been
my dream

567
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,991
to take that picture
of you, Jake.

568
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,659
- Oh.
- Yeah.

569
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,894
Yeah!

570
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,296
$21 million, Raymond.

571
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,298
I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

572
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,666
Sorry to disappoint you,
Madeline.

573
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,901
I know you'd hoped
we'd fail.

574
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,970
Oh, no, I couldn't
be happier.

575
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,439
Wait...
Why would you say that?

576
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,574
And why aren't you
clenching

577
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,377
your little rat hands
in anger?

578
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,014
You didn't want me
to fail.

579
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,482
You wanted me
to succeed.

580
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,686
I was looking for an excuse
to promote you to a desk job,

581
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,888
and you handed it to me
on a silver platter

582
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,390
with your little
rat hands.

583
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,524
Oh, no.

584
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,627
Say good-bye
to the Nine-Nine, Raymond.

585
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm making you head
of NYPD Public Relations.

586
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,633
Captain,
get in here with me.

587
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,768
Go ahead.
Smile for the cameras, Raymond.

588
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,737
That's your new job now.

589
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,305
[cameras clicking]

590
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,506
Hey!

591
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,308
Okay, quick,
let's pose back-to-back

592
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,443
with our arms crossed
and a cocky smirk.

593
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,947
You doing it?
Your arms crossed?

594
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,715
No, arms down.
That's good.
