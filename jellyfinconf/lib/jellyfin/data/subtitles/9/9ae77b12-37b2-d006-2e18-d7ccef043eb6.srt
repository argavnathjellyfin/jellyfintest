00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,634
Hey, Gina,
you got that file

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,069
I needed Captain Holt
to sign?

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,071
Uh-huh.

00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,484
Gina hasn't taken her eyes
off her phone in two hours.

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,552
First person to make her
look up wins the pot.

7
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:24,156
A bet which improves
someone's manners? Double score.

8
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,457
Sorry, guys.
I got this in the bag.

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,226
I used to have to distract her
from her phone

10
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:29,428
all the time
when we were smooshin' booties.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,030
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,065
Hey, girl...

00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,467
[grunts]
Catch you later.

00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,070

[disco music playing]

16
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,141
She's dancing even better
than normal.

17
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,742
Oh, my God,
did you hear

18
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,611
that George W. Bush died?

19
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,712
Who dat?

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,347
[air horn blowing]

21
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:52,151
Gina may never look at another
real human being again.

22
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,152
She's unbeatable.

23
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:56,488
Oh, I don't know
about that.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,458
Terrence Jeffords,
are you kidding me?

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,594

00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,633

00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,601
Hey, baby.

30
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,603
No! No, no, no.
It was a mistake.

31
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,605
My thumb slipped and--

32
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,640
I have to go home.

00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,163
today is the greatest day
of my life.

37
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,633
Guess who just got murdered!

38
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,236
That's right--
it's Carl Mather.

39
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,537
[gasps dramatically]

40
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,738
What? I'm the only
one gasping?

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,608
Guys, Carl Mather?
Did 25 years in Attica--

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,776
[gasps dramatically]

43
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,278
Just point at me
when you want me to gasp.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,480
Will do.

45
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,682
Mather is part
of the Fulton Street Four.

46
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,552
They stole $21 million
from an armored car depot.

47
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,554
Feds caught them
but they never found the money.

48
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,357
- Until now.
- You found $21 million?

49
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,192
Oh, God no.
Not yet.

50
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,794
I can see how that
would be confusing though.

51
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,496
I'm sorry.
But I'm going to.

52
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,365
all four of these guys
have been released,

53
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,833
and now one of them
shows up dead.

54
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,468
Someone's after that money,

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,504
and they're willing
to kill for it.

56
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:19,705
[gasps dramatically]

57
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,839
(Holt)
You're getting ahead of
yourself.

58
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,207
You don't know
that Mather's death

59
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,477
Don't turn this into something
bigger than it is,

60
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,281
not with Madeline Wuntch
watching us at all times.

61
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,417
Ew. When'd they put that in?

62
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,219
(Holt)
Right after Wuntch got promoted.

63
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,155
She had it installed
at that height so she'd,

64
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,891
I quote, "always be looking
down at me," unquote.

65
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,425
Treat this like a regular case.

66
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,428
Sir, with all due respect,
this is an epic case.

67
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,630
It's the reason I became a cop.

68
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,864
I mean,
hunting down a murderer,

69
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,633
recovering millions
in stolen money,

70
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,868
rappelling out of a chopper
with a knife between my teeth.

71
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,236
Why would you jump
out of a helicopter

72
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,304
with a knife
in your mouth?

73
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,372
It's called a chopper,

74
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,742
because both of my hands
are holding giant machine guns.

75
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,577
And that's how it's going down.

76
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,247
Okay, reminder,
tomorrow we are hosting

77
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,917
a field trip for
the Brooklyn Park Magnet School.

78
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,752
Sorry, Sarge, I can't be
around magnets.

79
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,755
I'm actually not gonna
correct you on that.

80
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,391
Guys, I really need this
to go well.

81
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,760
My girls are on the wait list
for their preschool

82
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,795
and it's twice as tough
to get in with twins.

83
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:20,232
and then let them take turns
going to school every other day?

84
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,534
Diaz, that's crazy.

85
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,869
I asked my wife
and she said no.

86
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,338
This field trip
has to go well.

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,240
This is my chance
to impress the principal.

88
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,675
Sarge, you're in luck.

89
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,877
I went to a magnet school
where I was voted

90
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,513
"most likely to befriend
a school administrator."

91
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,714
Oh, Amy.

92
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,549
Preteens
are my people.

93
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,251
I speak their language.

94
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,386
They are gonna have
an amazing time.

95
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,921
Thanks, guys.
That's great.

96
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,389
If you want, I can show them
some of the cool stuff

97
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,624
we have in the evidence locker.

98
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,492
I'm pretty sure
there's a bag of hands in there.

99
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,927
Whoa! No. No.

100
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,762
We got to make
this place kid-friendly.

101
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,598
No crime scene photos
lying about.

102
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,899
That's not a crime scene.

103
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,401
That's a boudoir photo
I'm having framed for my wife.

104
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,503
That's me underneath
the mask.

105
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,538
Oh, God!

106
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,240
[police radio mumbling]

107
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,375
(Jake)
Next, let's get statements
from the neighbors.

108
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,778
Quick update: another one
of the Fulton Street Four

109
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,916
Huh, I'm surprised you're
not celebrating inappropriately.

110
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,918
This is a crime scene
and I'm a professional.

111
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,253
You did it
before I showed up?

112
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,654
Yeah, that is
exactly correct.

113
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,290
So two of these guys murdered
in the past two days?

114
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,658
It has to be tied
to the missing money.

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,726
Admit I was right.

116
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,794
Circumstances do suggest
a connection.

117
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,864
- You were right.
- Yes! Did you get it, Boyle?

118
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,366
Oh, the camera
was in selfie mode,

119
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:31,336
Unfortunately, because this case
has turned out to be important,

120
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,571
that she-skunk
Madeline Wuntch

121
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,306
has her hindquarters
pointed right at it.

122
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,807
She wants to see us
in her office,

123
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,709
no doubt to give the case
to Major Crimes.

124
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,877
No, no, no.
We can't let that happen.

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,878
Sir, we have
to do something.

126
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,946
Fine.
I'll seduce her.

127
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,849
and give her a glimpse
of the quad cities.

128
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,651
No. No.
That's not what I meant.

129
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,852
I meant we have
to fight her.

130
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,787
We're not gonna fight her.
She's the devil.

131
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,656
And you don't dance
with the devil,

132
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,624
because you get
burned.

133
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,925
Also, because
in Madeline's case,

134
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,294
she has no rhythm
and her hands

135
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,828
are like little
rat claws.

136
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,898
If she wants the case,
it's hers.

137
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,833
For the record,
you're turning this murder scene

138
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,468
into a real bummer-scape.

139
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,038
Oh, the camera was in
selfie mode again,

140
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,406
but I was really
laughing hard.

141
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:13,912
Okay, kids, this is where my
detective squad solves crimes.

142
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,648
- Wow.
- This is my desk.

143
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,651
You can tell by the framed
200-piece puzzle

144
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,520
my three-year-olds
put together on their own.

145
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,455
That's very advanced,
Sergeant Jeffords.

146
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,624
Is it? I wouldn't know
what milestones

147
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,027
are impressive to a school
admissions officer.

148
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,096
They can count to 20
in English and Mandarin.

149
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,332
Hi. Detective Santiago,

150
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,533
magnet school
alumna.

151
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,967
Well, I appreciate
that you used

152
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,803
the proper declension
of alumnus.

153
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,738
Well, some say Latin
is a dead language,

154
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,074
but I say it's just
taking a long nap.

155
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,376
[all laughing]

156
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,479
(Gina)
Okay, you two are obviously
the alphas.

157
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,814
Let me guess.

158
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,416
You're dating
the blond kid

159
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,352
and you like
Filipino Bieber

160
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,786
but you're worried
he's still into

161
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,389
Little Miss Side Braid
Janky Purse.

162
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,490
How did you know?

163
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,059
[chuckles]
I know so much.

164
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,894
Hi, I'm Gina.

165
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,063
[chuckles]
Hey.

166
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,066
[clears throat]

167
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,601
Hello, Raymond.

168
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,804
How do you like
my new office? 20th floor.

169
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,473
Yes, I never thought
I'd see you this high

170
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,574
without a broom
under you.

171
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,808
Enough niceties.
Have a seat.

172
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,678
Thanks, but I'm actually
fine standing.

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,515
I could stay in these
bad boys all day.

174
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,484
So two members
of the Fulton Street Four

175
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,486
have been murdered--
sounds like a big case.

176
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,454
No, it's actually
the opposite.

177
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,590
Pretty much
an NBT sitch.

178
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,024
No big thang.

179
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,927
The word is "thing,"
and the thing is big.

180
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,563
We believe someone is after
the missing $21 million,

181
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,966
and solving this murder
could lead us to the money.

182
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,402
Sure, but that money's,
like, 25 years old.

183
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,803
It's probably not
even good anymore.

184
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,072
[grunts]
Sorry. Cramped up.

185
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,808
This is a very
important case, Raymond,

186
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,077
to me, and to the city
of New York.

187
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,413
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine
has the resources

188
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,947
to deal with something
of this magnitude.

189
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,816
I understand
the politics.

190
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,651
This is a
high-profile case.

191
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,453
Do what you must.

192
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,054
What I was going
to say is,

193
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,923
since you don't have
the resources,

194
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,158
I'll give you
anything you need.

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,926
The case is yours.
You have my full support.

196
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,496
He meant that more excited.
Like, "What!"

197
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,171
My hunch--one of them
is killing off his co-scums

198
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,906
so he can keep the money
for his scum-self.

199
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,474
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.

200
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,576
He listed a Brooklyn address
with his parole officer.

201
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,944
We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

202
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,547
then we're gonna have
the son of a bitch.

203
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,081
Either way, this case
is gonna be awesome.

204
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,918
Peralta, I'm putting myself
on this investigation with you.

205
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,686
- What? Why?
- Wuntch is up to something.

206
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,955
There's only one reason why
she would let us keep this case.

207
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,858
"That's the guy I want
flying my chopper."

208
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,992
You know how
to fly a chopper?

209
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,194
How hard could it be?

210
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,764
She let us keep this case
because she wants us to fail.

211
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,699
I'm coming along
so that you don't waste

212
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,935
time and resources
turning this investigation

213
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,636
into another
Ron McClane movie.

214
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,805
Oh, you know
it's John McClane.

215
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,208
I've made my decision.
End of discussion.

216
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,079
I signed out that drug dealer's
Lamborghini from the impound.

217
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,180
It only has two seats.

218
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,815
I saw that you had made
that request.

219
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,650
I changed it
to a sensible sedan.

220
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,118
Okay, but the sunroof
stays open.

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,253
There is no
sunroof.

222
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,522
Why did you even
become a cop?

223
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,824
Oh, great job, kids.

224
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,993
Don't solve too many crimes
and put me out of business.

225
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,162
Terry's got to pay the rent.
[laughs]

226
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,600
Dr. Susman wants
a private chat with me.

227
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,668
Thanks for warming her up,
Santiago.

228
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,970
They didn't give
eighth grade Amy

229
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,572
the key to the teacher's lounge
just for nothing.

230
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,708
I stocked their fridge
and cleaned up after them.

231
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,110
Great. So can you take over
with the kids for a minute?

232
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,645
They're done
with this activity.

233
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,915
Of course.
I am amazing with kids.

234
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,284
[laughs nervously]
Okay.

235
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,554
I haven't listened to rap music
in three years.

236
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,222
I don't know the lingo.
You have to do this.

237
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,658
I can't--McKenzie is
in the bathroom right now

238
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,561
freaking out because Kelsey S.
made out with Hayes

239
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,097
even though she knows
Brianna's into him.

240
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,232
So unless you want
the spring dance

241
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,201
to be a total
drama fest,

242
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,103
I have to be there
for her.

243
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,839
Honestly, you should show them
a picture of a dead body.

244
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,676
No! Rosa, Terry said
to keep it kid-friendly.

245
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,579
Okay, I'll just show them
the stuff that I was into

246
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,647
when I was their age.

247
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,248
- I'm done.
- What do we do now?

248
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,684
- What's next?
- Hello, friends.

249
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,853
Who here would like to see
a presentation

250
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,987
about crime statistics

251
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,723
as a function
of demographics and time?

252
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,895
Who wants to see
a picture of a dead body?

253
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,297
(all)
Me!

254
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,801
Bludsoe lives at the end
of his hall.

255
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,304
Hmm--I would have preferred
an abandoned lighthouse

256
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,572
or a dilapidated barn,

257
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,873
but I can embellish
in my memoirs.

258
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,207
Oh, I can't wait
to read that book.

259
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,842
What are you gonna
call it?

260
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,644
[in gravelly voice]
"Go Ahead, Jake My Day."

261
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,114
No, yours is much better.

262
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,916
"Case Closed, Jake Open."

263
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,051
- Wow.
- I know.

264
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,319
I said yours was better.

265
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,920
Whatever.
Let's just do this.

266
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,192
[pounding]

267
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,927
NYPD. Open up.

268
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,598
[clock clicking open]

269
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,035
Hey, check it out.

270
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,236
(Jake)
Half-packed suitcase.

271
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,838
Looks like Bludsoe
was planning a trip

272
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,239
until he got
interrupted by someone.

273
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,908
- Or something.
- Like what?

274
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,710
I don't know--I just thought
it would help the intrigue.

275
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:12,777
It did.

276
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,146
Come on, how many people
have to get killed

277
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,650
You do know it's our job
to stop the killing, right?

278
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,251
Wait a second.
[sniffs]

279
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,853
I think I smell
a dead body.

280
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,288
[sniffs]

281
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,224
[clears throat]
Nope. My mistake.

282
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,726
Wait! Don't close that.

283
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,127
(Jake)
Look. Handprint.

284
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,396
That's a fake wall.

285
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,831
NYPD.

286
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,866
Come out with your hands
on your head.

287
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,635
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

288
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,036
He's trying
to kill me.

289
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,405
So I guess, if I had
to sum them up,

290
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,273
Cagney is
the intellectual one,

291
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:46,945
whereas Lacey is more
of your traditional prodigy.

292
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,314
Well, your daughters
sound great.

293
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,183
You know, I'm gonna look over
their applications again.

294
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,752
Oh, no, that's not
necessary.

295
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,422
But what really matters
is that your students

296
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,691
have an amazing
experience here today.

297
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,260
They are.

298
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,262
Look, Rosa.
Sarge is here.

299
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,363
Oh, my God.

300
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,399
[shrieking horror music]

301
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,234
Children, get out
of this room immediately.

302
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,170
(whispering angrily)
What the hell, guys?

303
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,204
They're 12 years old.

304
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,372
I would've killed
to have seen

305
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,440
a bag of hands
at that age.

306
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,908
I'm so sorry--
I tired to be myself

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,745
- Where were you?
- Saving the day.

308
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,247
Hayes is out
of the picture.

309
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,283
The McKenzie/Kelsey S.
beef is squashed,

310
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,252
and Brianna's going
to the dance with Aidan,

311
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,788
who's a much better match
for her anyway, BT-dubs.

312
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,956
How does any of that help me?

313
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,426
- Dr. Susman--
- Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.

314
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,227
I think this experience
has been

315
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,729
more than enough
for the children.

316
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,130
We're done here.

317
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,132
I was walking home
from the coffee shop.

318
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,967
I have a job
bussing tables there.

319
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,269
Anyway, the next thing
I know,

320
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,137
Mikey D has a gun
in my back.

321
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,706
Michael D'Angelo,
the other member

322
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,809
Yes, believe it or not,
I familiarized myself

323
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,410
with the names
of all two suspects

324
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,813
in this high-profile homicide
we're investigating.

325
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,015
I fought him off,
but he got my key.

326
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,149
What's the key for?

327
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,384
Each of us had one,

328
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,453
and you needed all four
to open the safe.

329
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,221
And what's
in the safe?

330
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,856
The $21 million.

331
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,957
Bing--pot--

332
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,125
Nope--I was gonna say bingo,

333
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,729
but then it was too late;
I was halfway through the word.

334
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,397
Bingpot works.
It's taking off.

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,232
It's taking off.

336
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,435
Captain, D'Angelo
has a place upstate.

337
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,738
The local sheriff says there's
a car in the driveway right now.

338
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,474
Okay, they're gonna have to
raid the place without us.

339
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,875
It'll take us two hours
to get up there.

340
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:24,876
Or we could take--

341
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,044
We are not taking
a helicopter.

342
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,378
You know I was
gonna say chopper.

343
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,080
Look, Peralta,
I know you're having fun,

344
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,415
but a helicopter
is exactly the kind

345
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,283
of wasteful expenditure
that Wuntch will use

346
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,885
to bury me
if something goes wrong.

347
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,286
- Okay, sir--
- Or...

348
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,155
It's the kind of thing
she'll crucify me

349
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,423
for not getting.

350
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,024
"You could've had
a chopper, Raymond.

351
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,292
"Why didn't you
take advantage?

352
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,128
Just a minute--
my cauldron's boiling over."

353
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,296
Yeah, but what
she actually said was,

354
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,232
[in Boston accent]
"Chopper's yours, Peralta."

355
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,500
Your impression
was better.

356
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,770
She may have called me
and I may have briefed her

357
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,873
because it's definitely
on its way right now!

358
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,940
I call middle seat!

359
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,014
This is awesome!

360
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,482
Okay, just so
we're clear,

361
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,950
from this point
forward,

362
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,852
my call sign
will be Death Blade.

363
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,387
And I'll be
Rum Tum Tugger.

364
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,923
No, Boyle.
No characters from <i>Cats.</i>

365
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,558
Dig deep.
Think of something scary.

366
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,859
Adolf Hitler.

367
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,027
No!

368
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,296
You will be...
Sidewinder.

369
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,165
All right, but I'm more scared
of Hitler.

370
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,033
How about you, Captain?
What's your call sign?

371
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,868
I will be
Captain Raymond Holt.

372
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,336
Uh-huh, I knew
you wouldn't play ball.

373
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,906
And that is why your call sign
is Wet Blanket.

374
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,441
Sidewinder,
this is Death Blade.

375
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,544
Do you copy, Sidewinder?
Over.

376
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,546
This is Sidewinder,
Death Blade.

377
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,447
I read you loud and clear.
Over.

378
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,817
Do you have a 20
on Wet Blanket, Sidewinder?

379
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,851
Over.

380
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,853
- I do have a visual--
- Over.

381
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,054
All right,
look, Captain,

382
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,222
Wuntch said that
we could have

383
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,523
anything we needed
to solve this case.

384
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,958
Yes, but why?

385
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,427
To catch a murder
who stole $21 million.

386
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,396
No, it's so that
when we do fail,

387
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,465
it'll be that much
more spectacular.

388
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,900
If we don't
get D'Angelo,

389
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,135
my career is over.

390
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,470
But if we do catch him,

391
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,373
your career will really
take off.

392
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,442
Chopper pun!

393
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,412
Dr. Susman,
I am so, so sorry.

394
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,214
Please don't hold this
against my daughters.

395
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,049
I would never
do that.

396
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,283
Preschool admissions
are based

397
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,551
on what we think
of the parents.

398
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,586
Oh, no.

399
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,854
Dr. Susman--

400
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,088
Nancy, if I may--

401
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,023
- You may not.
- Okay.

402
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,860
Look, our methods may have been
a little unorthodox,

403
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,228
and perhaps
a little--

404
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,529
Graphic and disgusting.

405
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,431
I was gonna go
with yucky...

406
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,633
But these kids
had fun today.

407
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,001
And they learned a lot.

408
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,536
Tricia,
what's Luminol?

409
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,538
It's used to look for blood
in a crime scene.

410
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,306
Even if a criminal
tried to clean it up,

411
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,308
the iron in blood
makes the chemical glow.

412
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,878
And, Bobby,
what's enucleation?

413
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,579
It's when someone
pops your eyeball out.

414
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,448
Probably should've used
a less gross example.

415
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,051
this is exactly the kind
of educational experience

416
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,553
I loved about my magnet school.

417
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,355
Well, there's something
to be said for that.

418
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,390
Also, and more importantly,

419
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,925
I got McKenzie and Brianna

420
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,426
to stop hating
on Kelsey S.

421
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,929
and now they're best friends--
you're welcome.

422
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,264
Wow, that's actually
impressive.

423
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,331
Thank you.

424
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,933
(Terry)
So, Dr. Susman,

425
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,469
let's just call this field trip
what it was--

426
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,637
a huge success.

427
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,572
It was...interesting.

428
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,407
(Bobby)
I saw a prostitute.

429
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,909
Not helping, kid.

430
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,445
[helicopter humming]

431
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,448
[upbeat hip-hop music]

432
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:25,523
â™ª

433
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,564
[slo-mo]
I'm Death Blade.

434
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:42,140
â™ª

435
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,509
D'Angelo's place
is just beyond those trees.

436
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,311
No one's gone in our out.

437
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,146
Good thing we got here
in time.

438
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,514
Flew in on a chopper.

439
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,549
Bell 412
or the A119 Koala?

440
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,584
It's classified.

441
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,386
Actually, it was
the 350B2.

442
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,089
(Jake whispering)
No, don't give him the "nice."

443
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,624
We haven't seen
any movement in the house,

444
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,259
but there are lights on
in the barn.

445
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,327
There's a barn?

446
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,695
What is your fascination
with barns?

447
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,596
It's where all the awesome
stand-offs happen--

448
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,333
rusty farm equipment, light
shining through bullet holes.

449
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,467
I'll bet you
at least one dove

450
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,570
I will take that bet,
because that's impossible.

451
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,172
We've got a team
on the back entrance,

452
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,440
a team watching the house,

453
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,576
Okay, tell your men
if they find the money first,

454
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,311
that I get to riffle it
next to my ear and go,

455
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,114
- Already told them, Jake.
- Love you, bud.

456
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,716
All right,
let's lock and load.

457
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,685
[suspenseful music]

458
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:34,625
â™ª

459
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,260
Dope.

460
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,498
[dove fluttering]
- [startles]

461
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,632
[sighs]

462
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,201
Moved faster
than I was expecting,

463
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,435
but still cool.

464
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,770
I don't see him.

465
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,572
Oh, he's here.

466
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:48,573
I can feel it.

467
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,174
He is.
He's dead.

468
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,176
- What?
- The body is right here.

469
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,780
Damn it!
Bludsoe played us.

470
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,281
[groans]

471
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,119
Pick up, pick up,
pick up.

472
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,587
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Peralta.

473
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,088
Is Bludsoe still in custody?

474
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,257
Yeah, we got him.
He's in his--

475
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,327
Ooh.

476
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,229
[groans angrily]

477
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,700
[clears throat]

478
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,669
So...good news first.

479
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:22,673
We're gonna be flying back
past a beautiful sunset.

480
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,776
Bad news--Bludsoe escaped
from the hospital

481
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,579
- [inhales angrily]
- But... Pretty sunset.

482
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,354
For him, that's like a full-on,
rage-fueled freak out.

483
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,590
The only thing worse is when
he stands perfectly still.

484
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,392
Oh, no, he's standing
perfectly still.

485
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,161
(Jake)
All right, I'm gonna go
talk to him.

486
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,328
Mm, no I'm not.

487
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,065
Yep, I am.
No, I'm not gonna do it.

488
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,199
Okay, I am.
I'm gonna go.

489
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,434
Okay.
Be careful.

490
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,569
- You're so brave.
- Thanks.

491
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,805
Hey, Captain.

492
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:57,442
Mostly about how Madeline Wuntch
will destroy me

493
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,710
because you wanted a helicopter
to play action movie.

494
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,479
I needed
the helicopter

495
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,081
because I was
chasing a bad guy

496
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,350
Really? It wasn't just
to make this case epic?

497
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,785
This case is epic.

498
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,421
You're just too wrapped up
in the politics to see it.

499
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,490
Sir, we're tracking
a triple murderer

500
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,858
who stole $21 million,

501
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,527
and all you can think about
is Madeline Wuntch.

502
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,129
[sighs]

503
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,365
- You're right.
- What's that now?

504
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,367
Before I came
to the Nine-Nine,

505
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,802
I was rotting away
behind a desk

506
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:28,840
All I wanted was the chance
to do good police work again.

507
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,408
I just got it,

508
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,809
and I blew it

509
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,779
thinking about
that devil toad.

510
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,181
I'm tired of politics.

511
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,617
Let's get that punk!
Bludsoe.

512
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,486
[gasps]
This is amazing.

513
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,887
Of course, we have no idea
where he is,

514
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,255
but I love where
your head's at.

515
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,356
He has no family.

516
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,292
or someone he worked with
at the coffee shop.

517
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,627
The coffee shop--
why would someone

518
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,629
who knows they have
$21 million coming

519
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,297
take a minimum wage job?

520
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,633
Because he needed
access to that building.

521
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,368
Because that's where
the money's hidden.

522
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,503
All right, we got
to get there quick.

523
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,837
Maybe we should
take the chopper.

524
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,273
[gasps]
You said chopper.

525
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,509
Death Blade,
Sidewinder,

526
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,810
it's go time!

527
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,211
Roger that, Wet Blanket.

528
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,747
No, from now on,
call me...

529
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,351
Velvet Thunder.

530
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,453
Okay.

531
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,724
Hey, Cagney and Lacey
got off the wait list.

532
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,526
Thank you, guys,
for helping me.

533
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,461
Rosa, I should've
listened to you.

534
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,762
Yeah, everyone should
listen to me

535
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,164
all the time
about everything.

536
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,332
It was pretty fun.
The kids actually liked me.

537
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,700
I wish I could go back
to middle school

538
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:30,701
knowing what I know now.

539
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,770
I'd be so cool.

540
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,739
And I'd get to retake
all the tests.

541
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,474
And update
some book reports.

542
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,777
Oh, un, Gina,
Dr. Susman said

543
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,779
you had a real impact
on those kids.

544
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,714
Apparently,
you were just named

545
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,550
Spring Dance Princess
somehow.

546
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,219
Mm-hmm, what am I
always telling you guys?

547
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm royalty.

548
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,322
(whispering)
All right, listen up.

549
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,890
We go in strong
and we go in fast.

550
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,592
Evans, you're on
door breach.

551
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,860
Patterson--
flashbang.

552
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,895
Boyle, stop squatting
like that.

553
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,363
Sorry, I thought
it looked cool.

554
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,831
- It didn't.
- On the count of three.

555
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,968
[bangs]
- It's Bludsoe!

556
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
- NYPD!
- Go, go, go!

557
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,505
Facedown,
flat on the ground!

558
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,340
[men shouting]
- Hey, over here, over here.

559
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,375
[policeman shouting]

560
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,510
[door creaking]

561
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,680
Bingpot!

562
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,283
[cameras clicking]

563
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,585
This rules.

564
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,486
Did you know that my dream
has always been to have

565
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,488
my picture taken with a mountain
of recovered cash?

566
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,623
And it's always been
my dream

567
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,991
to take that picture
of you, Jake.

568
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,659
- Oh.
- Yeah.

569
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,894
Yeah!

570
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,296
$21 million, Raymond.

571
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,298
I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

572
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,666
Sorry to disappoint you,
Madeline.

573
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,901
I know you'd hoped
we'd fail.

574
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,970
Oh, no, I couldn't
be happier.

575
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,439
Wait...
Why would you say that?

576
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,574
And why aren't you
clenching

577
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,377
your little rat hands
in anger?

578
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,014
You didn't want me
to fail.

579
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,482
You wanted me
to succeed.

580
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,686
I was looking for an excuse
to promote you to a desk job,

581
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,888
and you handed it to me
on a silver platter

582
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,390
with your little
rat hands.

583
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,524
Oh, no.

584
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,627
Say good-bye
to the Nine-Nine, Raymond.

585
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm making you head
of NYPD Public Relations.

586
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,633
Captain,
get in here with me.

587
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,768
Go ahead.
Smile for the cameras, Raymond.

588
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,737
That's your new job now.

589
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,305
[cameras clicking]

590
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,506
Hey!

591
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,308
Okay, quick,
let's pose back-to-back

592
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,443
with our arms crossed
and a cocky smirk.

593
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,947
You doing it?
Your arms crossed?

594
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,715
No, arms down.
That's good.
