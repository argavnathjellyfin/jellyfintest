Goose bumps.

00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,447

- Check.

- Check.

- What?
That's not on the checklist.

11
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,419
- I added it
because I care about you.

12
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,454

- Unacceptable.

You busted through a window

00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,105
- Basic police tactic, Sarge.
Cover every exit.

41
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,356
- It was a sealed window
on the fifth floor.

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,326
You could have just
gone in the door with Charles.

43

84

- What are you talking about?

85
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,909
- Your shoulders tightened
when he said "baby."

86
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,477
Your nostrils flared
when I asked

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,711
what was going on
with the two of you.

88
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,313
And you have saag paneer
on your sleeve,

89
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,882
which, given your aversion
to Indian cuisine,

90
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,218
suggests you let him
choose the restaurant.

91
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,252
Why would you do that?

92
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,354
- Kindness.
- Pity.

93
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,489
You're about
to break up with him.

94
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,492
- Damn, you are good.
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,427
- Things aren't working out.

96
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,862
I don't want to talk about it.

97
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,296
- I regret the words
we've already spoken.

98
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,200
Listen, I know I probably
shouldn't get involved,

99
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,901
but Marcus is my nephew,

100
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,904
and I hope you'll
let him down gently.

101
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,239
- Don't worry.

102
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,840
I don't want things
to be awkward.

103
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,442
I'm gonna send him a text
while he's sleeping

104
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,510
that says, "We're done."

105
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,478
- Clear. Accurate.

106
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,781
But do you feel
like it's enough?

107
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,683
- "We're done.

108
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,717
Good-bye."

109
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,353
- Yes.
That should do it.

110
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,654
- What's going on, Peralta?

111
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,889
Charles says
you're going to make me

112
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,591
happier than I was
on my wedding night.

113
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,992
- Well, that's not how
I would have put it,

114
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,228
but I know you were mad at me
for ruining blooper time,

115
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,230
so I did all your paperwork.

116
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,297
- That's not helpful.

117
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,765
You always make
a thousand mistakes.

118
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,467
- Mm-hmm, that's what
Amy said as well

119
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,735
right before she
took over for me,

120
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,869
so it's perfect.

121
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,838
- Okay.
Hey, thanks, man.

122
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,839
I appreciate it.

123
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,408
- And I spoke with Sharon.

124
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,543
I spoke with Captain Holt.

125
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,978
And we all agree that
you deserve a break.

126
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,714
So this weekend,
Charles and I

127
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,515
are taking you
to the great outdoors

128
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,884
to Detective Lohank's cabin.

129
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,720
- Boom.
Suck it, wedding night.

130
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,322
- Lohank?
That sad sack?

131
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,590
All he does is talk
about his wife

132
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,658
sleeping with other men.

133
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,426
- No, he also has
some great stories

134
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,761
about his prostate cancer.

135
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,329
- Besides, he's not
sticking around.

136
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,464
It's just the three of us.

137
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,832
- Those woods
are full of ticks.

138
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,033
It's Lyme disease central.

139
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,501
- So we'll get
some bug spray.

140
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,470
- Plus that cabin's
probably covered in black mold.

141
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,839
- Racist.
- You know what?

142
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,808
I am gonna stay home
and have a blooper bath.

143
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,644
- Oh, come on, Sarge.

144
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,711
It's gonna be fun.

145
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,879

146
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,980
- What's that
supposed to mean?

147
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,382
- Nothing.
It's just--

148
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,950
I planned this awesome
guys' weekend for us,

149
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,818
and all you can think about
is Lyme disease.

150
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,253
- Untrue.

151
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,687
I'm thinking about
all tick-borne diseases--

152
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,027
anaplasmosis, tularemia,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

153
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,596
You know, maybe I could
just chill out a little.

154
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,498
- Yes.
You're stressed.

155
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,633
A little fun would
do you good, I promise.

156
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,037
- You know what?
You're right.

157
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,005
You all better get ready
for fun Terry.

158
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,607
- Ooh, fun Terry.
He sounds fun.

159
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,542
- Oh, he's crazy.

160
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,810
Thanks for planning this, Jake.

161
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,479
- No, thank you
for being amazing

162
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,914
and also for driving us
up to the cabin.

163
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,849
My car's in the shop,
and riding in Charles's

164
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,618
is like sitting inside
of a dog's behonkus.

165
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,852
Fun Terry.
Can't wait.

166
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,355
- Hey, Gina.
Would you do me a favor?

167
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,357
- Yes, thank you
for asking.

168
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,093
I did not feel like
doing this work right now.

169
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,028
- Oh, those look like
important papers.

170
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,030
- What's up?
How can I help?

171
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,800
- Well, when I was a kid,

172
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,902
I invented a magnetic
flashlight clip

173
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,706
so I could read
under the covers.

174
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,909
This clip and I went
all around the world together--

175
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:48,113
the Shire, Sweet Valley High,
Terabithia.

176
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,115
- But never
to a friend's house, huh?

177
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,917
- Uncalled for.

178
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,353
Anyway, I realized that this
could be really helpful

179
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,355
for police work,
so I made an appointment

180
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,923
with the head
of NYPD purchasing.

181
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,891
I have to sell him on it,
but I'm afraid

182
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,028
I might come across
a little boring.

183
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,731
- [gasps]
Amy, are you asking me

184
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,898
to "She's All That" you?

185
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,567
- I didn't read that.

186
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,136
But if it's about
helping out a friend, then yes.

187
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,072
Please "She's All That" me.

188
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,073
- Okay.

189
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,509
But if we're gonna do this,

190
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,711
we're gonna do it my way,
all right?

191
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,514
First I'm going to need
to break you down to nothing

192
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,649
and then build you back up
piece by piece.

193
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,118
- Well, the meeting's
tomorrow.

194
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,586
- Well, we'll just
break you down to nothing

195
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,920
and see what time it is.

196
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,424
- Mmm!
What is that smell?

197
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,993
- That is the absence of urine.

198
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,628
You got to leave Brooklyn
to get that.

199
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,597
- No urine--
I could get used to this.

200
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,765
- Oh, yes.

201
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,400
And that's just the beginning,
my friend.

202
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,034
Just wait till
you're sitting fireside,

203
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,003
sipping on a premium
Chinese Scotch,

204
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,172
and smoking a sweet
Rwandan cigar.

205
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,774
- Okay.
Okay.

206
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,176
I probably could have done
without the countries of origin,

207
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,611
but that sounds great.

208
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,912
- Yeah.
- What else do you have planned?

209
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,448
- Oh, so much.
I'm talking fishing.

210
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,116
I'm talking poker.
I'm talking Frisbee.

211
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,651
Boyle, what else
am I talking?

212
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,787
- Wildflower picking so we can
make our own cologne.

213
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,922
- Nope, I was talking
bonfires and s'mores,

214
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,624
but that's my fault
for throwing to you.

215
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,992
- This is going to be
fun as hell.

216
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,528
- This is going to be
the best weekend ever!

217
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,030
- Welcome to Stink Puddle Manor.

218
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,565
- Stink Puddle?

219
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,200
- Manor.

220
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,103
- Just out of curiosity,
why would you

221
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,137
name your house
Stink Puddle?

222
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,355
- Oh, I didn't.

223
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,572
The home inspector
came up with it.

224
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,842
I can't smell anything
since the radiation therapy.

225
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,944
- Another great story, eh?

226
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,047
- So there's no power,
no heat.

227
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,415
- Is there running water?

228
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,782
- Of course there's
running water.

229
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,884
Oh, but I wouldn't use it.

230
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,186
It's very contaminated.

231
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,520
We had three dogs
die in the well.

232
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,655
- Three?

233
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,923
- If they weren't
all tied together,

234
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,591
we might have just
lost the one.

235
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,626
Sad thing is, they were
therapy dogs for my son.

236
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,894
- Oh.

237
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,863
- He had real abandonment issues
after my wife left.

238
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,315
It was kind of like
an emotional scar

239
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:47,766
on an emotional scar.

240
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,601
- But the woods are
super nice, right?

241
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,936
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Gorgeous.

242
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,671
Except during sinkhole season.

243
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,839
- When's sinkhole season?

244
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,507
- It's been going on for,
like, 20 years now.

245
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,175
It's kind of like
a "Game of Thrones" winter.

246
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,176
- Right. Yeah.

247
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,744
- Anyway, I'll leave
you guys to it.

248
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,879
Have fun.

249
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,914
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

250
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,449
For instance,

251
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,983
drink the water
or let your wife

252
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,052
go on work trips.

253
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,653
- Duly noted.

254
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,055
<i>- You wanted to see me?</i>

255
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,723
- I told Kevin about
how I approved

256
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,191
of your strategy
for breaking up with Marcus,

257
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,495
and he said that we were
"sociopaths."

258
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,496
- So you're gonna leave him?

259
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,531
- No, I think he may
have a point.

260
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,801
You might need to do more
than simply text.

261
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,636
- A long, drawn-out breakup
is just gonna end

262
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,838
in a big scene
and Marcus crying.

263
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,108
He has so many emotions.

264
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,210
- [sobbing]

265
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:36,648
It's just so beautiful
how much they love each other.

266
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,650
- It's a commercial

267
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,951
for a refrigerator.

268
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,653
- Yes, it is daunting.

269
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,556
But I did some research
on amicable breakups.

270
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,827
I visited
www.ladiesgoodhealthmag.com/

271
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:59,738
6-relationships/867599904/
9432&20.html.

272
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,606
Do you know that site?
- No.

273
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,909
- Well, apparently,
it's less painful

274
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:08,547
if you acknowledge
the dumpee's feelings.

275
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,814
- Ew.
- But don't worry.

276
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,550
We'll practice.
Hmm?

277
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,885
I'll be Marcus.
Go.

278
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,120
- [clears throat]

279
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,023
Marcus, I think
we should break up.

280
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,791
- That makes me feel sad.

281
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,825
I am sad.

282
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,960
- Your sadness is noted.

283
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,795
- I feel acknowledged.

284
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,297
Thank you for breaking up
with me.

285
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,633
It will take me eight minutes
to collect my things.

286
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,801
I think that went very well.

287
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,835
- Hmm.

288
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,237
- Okay, creek.

289
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,941
I'd like three fresh trout
to go, please.

290
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,243
<i>[percussive music]</i>

291
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,711
It just went straight up.

292
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,680
Now it's coming down.
Oh, boy!

293
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,949
- Watch and learn, losers.

294
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,084
Yah!

295
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,953
- I didn't see where it went.
- Back of my neck.

296
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,255
It's in the back of my neck.
[groans]

297
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,358
- Okay, I've learned
from your mistakes.

298
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,763
Not too hard,
late release, and...

299
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,265
[water splashes]

300
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,067
- That was fun.
Fishing was fun.

301
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,168
- Yeah.
- Back to the cabin?

302
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

303
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,171
- Before we get
into your pitch,

304
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,839
what are you
calling the product?

305
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,910
- The Handless Lighting System,
or HLS.

306
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,912
- Sounds like
a genetic disorder.

307
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,648
How's about
Shoulder Nova?

308
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,083
- I love it.
Amazing.

309
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,250
It's perfect.

310
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,885
- Now let's talk presentation.

311
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,654
What's your opener?

312
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,756
- Hi, I'm Amy Santiago,

313
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,292
and my product will make
a real difference.

314
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,794
It is the Shoulder Nova.

315
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,698
- My only note is, make it
1000% more captivating.

316
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,333
- Very good note.
Yeah.

317
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,768
Okay.

318
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,070
I got it.
[clears throat]

319
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,406
Mm...

320
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,675
Ding.

321
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:48,313
Oh, hello.
I'm Amy Santiago.

322
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,415
Was that captivating enough?

323
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,918
- Weirdly, it might have been
a scooch too captivating.

324
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,353
Here's what I'm thinking.

325
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,956
Mm-kay?
You can take a seat.

326
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,958
- Okay.

327
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,663
- Until this moment,
there was only darkness.

328
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:08,166
But now there is...

329
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,234
light.

330
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,235
- [sighs]

331
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,103
- I am Vanessa Santiago,

332
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,940
and I'm about
to blow your minds.

333
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,442
- You want me to change
my name to Vanessa?

334
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,210
- Desperately.

335
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,680
- I got to say,
the Chinese

336
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,682
know how to make
a terrible scotch.

337
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,849
- They certainly do.

338
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,685
Ugh, it's bad.
Gets you drunk, though.

339
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,319
- Well, I found
all the worms.

340
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,288
They're eating a fox corpse
in the outhouse.

341
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,791
- Speaking of which,
I'm getting hungry.

342
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,392
What's for dinner?
- Dinner?

343
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,362
[laughs nervously]
Yes, of course. Dinner.

344
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,830
- Did you not pack any food?

345
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,964
- There's fresh fox.

346
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,366
- Oh, it is not fresh.

347
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,734
- Are you serious?

348
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,101
We stopped three times
on the way up here

349
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,305
to buy fireworks, and you
never thought to get groceries?

350
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,473
What was in those coolers?

351
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,974
- The fireworks.

352
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,410
Look, I thought we would be
incredible at fishing.

353
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,012
Excuse me for
believing in us.

354
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,348
- It'll be okay, guys.
No need to worry.

355
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,085
I just took a foraging class,
and not to brag,

356
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,953
I was voted Mr. Fungus.

357
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,089
- Aha, Mr. Fungus
to the rescue.

358
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,724
See, Sarge, everything's
going to work out,

359
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,226
and you don't have to stress
all the time.

360
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,727
- Boyle, you really think
you can find us dinner?

361
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,396
- [laughing]
Um, let's just say

362
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,898
it's gonna be
a "spore-gasbord."

363
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,366
<i>[percussive music]</i>

364
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,102
- Something bad happened
to Charles, didn't it?

365
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,203
- Big time.

366
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,838
Oh God,
what if the last thing

367
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,806
we ever heard him say
was "spore-gasbord?"

368
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,311
- Charles!
Charles!

369
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,779
I'm starting
to get worried, Jake.

370
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,013
- Relax.

371
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,915
If anybody can handle it
out here, it's Charles.

372
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,017
He saw "Into the Woods"
ten times in the theater.

373
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,452
- Watch it.
That's poison ivy.

374
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,387
- Whoa. good call.

375
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,123
I'm allergic to poison ivy.

376
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,758
I got it one time
at sports camp,

377
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,460
making out in the woods
with Liz Almont.

378
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,329
Okay, fine.
We weren't making out.

379
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,765
I was looking
for my inhaler.

380
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,200
And it wasn't sports camp.
It was asthma camp.

381
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,903
- Hey, Jake.
Are we lost?

382
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,037
- What? No.

383
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,906
We're on an "adventure."

384
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,040
Right, Fun Terry?

385
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,175
- Fun Terry's gone.

386
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,943
He starved to death an hour ago.

387
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,311
This is Original Terry.

388
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,446
- That's the worst Terry.

389
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,249
- You didn't bring a map
or a flashlight

390
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,284
or anything that could keep us
from getting lost?

391
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,286
- Yes, I brought
all of those things.

392
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,788
It's called a cell phone.

393
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,823
Map. Flashlight.
Compass.

394
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,324
An app that makes me
sound like T-Pain.

395
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,059
Nope, the battery's dead.
Now it's just a brick.

396
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,561
But don't freak out.

397
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,830
I don't need an app
to sound like T-Pain, right?

398

[nasally]
♪ We're totally lost ♪

399
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,470
Yeah, that was a little
more Kermit, but--

400
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,073
- Oh, you're back.

401
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,508
How did the breakup go?

402
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,942
- I tried to acknowledge
his feelings.

403
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,444
It wasn't easy.
There were a lot of them.

404
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,414
- I'm just so confused.

405
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,150
So sad.

406
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,418
Are you climbing
out the window?

407
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,586
- No.

408
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,288
I climbed back in,
and we talked about emotions

409
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,455
for 20 minutes.

410
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,824
- Dear God.
- I know.

411
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,891
But I think it went well.

412
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,959
At least there was no crying.

413
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,360
- Well done, Diaz.

414
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,162
- I'm actually really glad
you made me do it this way.

415
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,432
I got to tell him that
even though it was ending,

416
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,601
it was incredibly
meaningful to me,

417
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,336
and I'm gonna miss him.

418
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,871
- Oh, no.

419
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,441
- This is exactly
what I didn't want.

420
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,044
- You crying?
Oof!

421
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,178
I deserved that.

422
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,280
- Charles is dead,
and we're next.

423
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,349
- All right, don't be
so melodramatic.

424
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,117
He's probably chewing
on bark and berries,

425
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,019
having the time of his life,
safe and sound.

426
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,421
- Terry! Jake!

427
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,489
- Ho, ho!
What's that I hear?

428
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,491
Charles Boyle,
safe and sound?

429
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,960
What are you saying, Charles?

430
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,494
That you're having
the time of your life?

431
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:26,231
- I fell in a sinkhole,
and I'm badly hurt!

432
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,967
- Damn it!

433
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,268
Boyle, what the hell?

434
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,568
- I know.
It's a pretty big hole, right?

435
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,937
- How'd you end up down there?

436
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,606
- I spotted
a gorgeous chanterelle.

437
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,308
I reached for it, but then
I rolled my ankle and fell in.

438
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,177
- All right, buddy, don't worry.
We got you, okay?

439
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,578
- I was so scared, you guys.

440
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,347
A psychic told me I was
gonna die alone in a pit,

441
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,915
and I kept telling myself,

442
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,917
"This is a hole, not a pit.
This is a hole, not a pit.

"This is a hole,
not a pit.

445
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,320
Charles, it's a hole,
not a pit."

446
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,156
- All right.
Here, grab me.

[grunts]

448
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,559
Take my hand, all right?

449
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,327
- Okay.

450
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,263
- Okay, now pull us up,
Terry.

451
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,631
- Oh crap, I'm slipping!

- No, it's Lohank's dogs
all over again!

455
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,573
- So in conclusion,

456
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,441
by eliminating
flashlight fumbling,

457
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,111
the Shoulder Nova could save
the average police officer

458
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,079
over 13,000 seconds.

459
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,383
- Wow, that sounds like
a lot, Vanessa.

460
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,584
- It is.

461
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,687
- I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

462
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,256
both: You have the right
to remain...

463
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,591
- Uhh!

464
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,226
both: Well lit!

00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,594
[clapping]

466
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,663
- Wow, that presentation
was terrific.

467
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,131
So fun to watch.

468
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,132
- Thank you, sir.

469
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,466
- See, the problem
is the product.

470
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,235
I just don't see
any need for it at all.

471
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,603
I just put the flashlight
in my mouth

472
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,671
when my hands are full.

473
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,940
- Sir, the human mouth
is nasty.

474
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,274
- Yeah, but mouths are free.

475
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,476
I'm sorry.
I'm just not interested.

476
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,113
- Okay.
Thank you for your time.

477
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,386
- You are scum.

479
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,690
- This isn't working.

480
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,324
- Great trip, Jake.
- Oh, thanks, man.

481
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,359
- You know that was
sarcastic!

482
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,460
- How?

483
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,695
- You didn't bring food
or water

484
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,496
or ask if Lohank's cabin

485
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,098
was straight out
of a horror movie.

486
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,466
Now you got us
trapped in a pit!

487
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,534
- Hole.

488
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,969
- Okay, I know
that things

489
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,303
are not looking great
right now,

490
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,038
but you have to admit,
you were having fun earlier.

491
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,574
- I'm not now.
I'm more stressed than ever.

492
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,009
- Maybe that's 'cause
you're just focusing

493
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,477
on the negative, Ter-bear.
I mean, look at Charles.

494
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,079
He's chill.
I'm chill.

495
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,348
- That's 'cause he's in shock!
You know what?

496
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,749
The reason you're so chill

497
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,618
is because you have everyone
cleaning up your messes for you.

498
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,221
Didn't bring food?
Charles will find mushrooms.

499
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,490
Smashed through a window?
Terry'll do the paperwork.

500
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,058
- Hey, I did the paperwork.

501
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,493
- No, Amy did it!

502
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,061
- Oh, guys, please,
please calm down.

503
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,429
I hate it when you argue.

504
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,331
It reminds of when my dad
used to fight

505
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,600
with my best friend--
my mom.

506
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,202
- I'm done with this.

507
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,603
I'm going to sleep.

508
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,938
Charles, spoon with me.

509
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,272
We need to huddle
together for warmth.

510
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,741
- No, Charles,
you're my best friend.

511
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,109
You're going
to spoon with me.

512
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,243
- I called first spoon.

513
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,511
Charles, get over here
right now.

514
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,613
- Boyle, don't throw away
a lifelong friendship

515
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,215
for a one-night spoon
with Terry.

516
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,616
- Okay, enough.
We're gonna stop fighting.

517
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,201
We're gonna lie down,

518
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:01,785
and we're gonna triple-spoon
like grown-ups!

519
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,622
Come on, bring it in.
Bring it in.

520
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,425
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

521
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,626
There, okay.

522
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,129
See, that's better, right?

523
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,097
So do we know any songs?

524
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,298
both: Shut up, Charles!

525
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,270
<i>[percussive music]</i>

526
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,805
- Jake?
Where's Jake?

527
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,540
Did you eat him, Terry?

528
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,641
- No!

529
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,577
- Good morning, guys!

530
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,812
- How'd you get out of the pit?

531
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,547
- Easy-peasy,
lemon squeezy.

532
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,215
Actually, it took me hours.

533
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,684
I tied all my clothes together,
tethered them to a log,

534
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,319
and used it
as a grappling hook.

535
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,055
Managed to snag it
in a root.

536
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,156
- Aren't you freezing?

537
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,157
- Not at all.

538
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,125
Mainly because
my skin is on fire

539
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,660
from all the poison ivy
in this tree.

540
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,728
[giggles]

541
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,829
- Why'd you do that?

542
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,798
Oh, let me guess.
Dumb mistake.

543
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,500
- No, dumb choice.

544
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,235
I didn't want to sit around
and wait for somebody

545
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,704
to clean up my mess.

546
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,172
- Hmm, I guess
I got through to you.

547
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,540
- Yeah.

548
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,576
Also, after you fell asleep,
Boyle really laid into me.

549
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,577
It was brutal.

550
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,345
- I got to say, Jake,
this time,

551
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,548
I think you're
only 99% right.

552
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,316
- [gasps]

553
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,818
- We're rolling.
- No!

554
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Argh!

555
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,288
[groans]

556
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,123
- Well, can you see anything
from up there?

557
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,324
- Yes, I can--

558
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,561
Stink Puddle Manor,
about 65 trees sunward.

559
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,795
Man, one day in the woods,

560
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,864
and I'm freakin'
Lewis and Clark up here.

561
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,666
<i>[door rattles]</i>
<i>- Thank you for coming, Diaz.</i>

562
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,501
I want to apologize
for yesterday.

563
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,270
Inserting myself into
my employee's breakup

564
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,540
with my nephew somehow,
uh, backfired.

565
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,076
- It's not your fault.

566
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,611
I'm the one that made a scene
like a dumb, crying baby.

567
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,781
I'm considering having
my tear ducts melted shut.

568
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,718
- It's not the end
of the world to feel...

569
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,786
things.

570
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,854
- I guess not.

571
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,322
It's up there.

572
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,624
The thing is,
I really care about Marcus,

573
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,292
but he wanted to get married,

574
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,862
and I'm just not
ready for that.

575
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,464
And if I'm not ready
with a guy as great as Marcus,

576
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,135
then what if I'm never ready?

577
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,402
[voice breaking]
What if that was it,

578
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,205
my one chance at love?

579
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,142
What if I never get
a second chance?

580
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,546
I don't know.
I'm just...

581
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,281
I'm just sad.

582
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:14,485
- Well, I understand.

583
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,854
It must be very difficult.

584
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,458
- Wait, are you crying?

585
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,327
- Yes.

586
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,428
[sighs]

587
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,164
Thank you for acknowledging
my feelings.

588
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,366
- Thank you for
acknowledging mine.

589
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,801
[both sobbing]

590
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,172
- We're both great at this.
- [sobs and sniffles]

591
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,841
- Hey, sport.

592
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,809
You look a little D in the D.

593
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,679
D for "down in dumps,"
respectively.

594
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,414
- Probably easier
to just not abbreviate

595
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,448
if you have to explain it.

596
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,816
- Agree to D.

597
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,585
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

598
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:51,589
- Yeah, thank you for all
your help with the presentation.

599
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,491
And I'm sorry you had
to waste your talent

600
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,226
on such a stupid product.

601
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,761
- Without product makers
like you,

602
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,596
us dazzle-doves
wouldn't have nothing

603
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,897
to shake our wings over.

604
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,266
- Yeah, but my invention
was useless.

605
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,435
- No, that scum was wrong.

606
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,971
I showed the Shoulder Nova
to a girl in my building.

607
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,840
She's like a mini Amy,
and she loved it.

608
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,943
She said she was gonna break
the world record

609
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:12,977
for speed-reading.

610
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,512
- Psh! Yeah.

611
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,381
Like some little girl's gonna
take down Yuri Jurgonav.

612
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,517
[both laugh]

613
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,453
- Anyway, I know
it wasn't what you wanted,

614
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,889
but you still made
a difference.

615
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,924
- Thanks, Gina.

616
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,427
I guess I did
make a D.

617
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,295
- Don't steal my thing.
- Okay.

618
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,598
- That's all I ask.
- I won't.

619
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,932
- Hey, Sarge.

620
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,768
Why'd you want us
to meet you out here?

621
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,303
- To thank you guys
for the weekend.

622
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,706
- Really?
It was a total disaster.

623
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,224
- Not a total disaster.

624
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,741
None of us got sick
from that dog water.

625
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,245
- You drank that?
- No.

626
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,447
- Look, Jake,
you were right.

627
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,882
I have kind of forgotten
how to have fun.

628
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,719
I'm going to try
to work on that, so...

629
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,020
- [gasps]

630
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,722
The fireworks
you made me surrender

631
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,523
when we reentered
New York!

632
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,660
- Uh-huh.
Fun Terry's back.

633
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,962
We're gonna set 'em off
in a big pile, all at once.

634
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,731
- By shooting our guns
at them?

635
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,532
- What? No.
- No.

636
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,001
- We're going to set 'em off
like normal people.

637
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:12,036
- Oh.
That's good too.

638
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,972
Ooh.

639
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,707
[fuse crackling]

640
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,875
Here we go.

00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,477
[fireworks popping]
Whoo-hoo!

642
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,745
[fireworks crackling
and whistling]

643
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,313
See how fun this is?

644
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,981
Original Terry
would have been worried

645
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,984
that we're standing too close
and need safety goggles,

646
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,419
and he would have been
absolutely right.

647
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,587
We're way too close.
Run!

648
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,755
[fireworks booming]

649
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,759
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
