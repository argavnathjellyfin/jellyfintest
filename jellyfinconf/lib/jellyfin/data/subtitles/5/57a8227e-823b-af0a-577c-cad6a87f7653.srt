00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,786
I didn't even have time
to lotion my forearms.

173
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,088
It's so weird
wearing Rosa's jacket.

174
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,923
There's a piece of barbed wire
in the pocket.

175
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,392
Cool.

176
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,426
All right,
do you have a visual on...

177
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,660
the hostess stand?

178
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,063
Hi.
Table for two, please.

179
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,065
I'm so sorry.
There's nothing available.

180
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,400
We're totally booked up.

181
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,102
Oh, no, that's horrible.

182
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,072
Tonight's a really important
night for us.

183
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,907
Johnny and I just got engaged,

184
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,676
and this is where
our first date was.

185
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,811
Oh, yeah,

186
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,813
it would mean so much
to Dora and me.

187
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,181
I would have made a reservation,

188
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,784
but I didn't know
if she was gonna say yes, so...

189
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:02,821
Oh, I love how nervous you were,
you little goose.

190
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,556
(woman)
You are just so sweet
together.

191
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,692
You know, I'm sure I can
find room for two young lovers.

192
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:12,097
(Jake)
Yeah, we are lovers...
together...in beds.

193
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,165
Okay.

194
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,036
- Your table is almost ready.
- Great.

195
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,671
Sorry about springing
the engagement

196
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,906
and romantic stuff on you.

197
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,174
No, no, no.
That was great.

198
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,042
I mean,
it's what got us in here.

199
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,944
Cheek kiss was a bit much.
Very wet.

200
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,479
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

201
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,847
Dora's sloppy.

202
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,082
(woman)
Okay,
and if you'll just follow me.

203
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,151
(Jake)
Well, the honeymoon's over,
Dora.

204
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,853
We're back
to being Jake and Amy,

205
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,755
two normal cops working a job.

206
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,889
All right,
there you go.

207
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,092
(woman)
You're the couple
that just got engaged.

208
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:46,498
That's us, Johnny and Dora,
a couple for sure.

209
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,204
Okay, according to my sources
in the assistant community,

210
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:56,107
the letter is right here
in the fourth-floor archives,

211
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,143
cabinet J-13.

212
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,845
Nice job.
What's the plan?

213
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,480
You sneak in
and get the letter.

214
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,081
I'll distract the file clerk.

215
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,717
Apparently, he's very
into bird watching,

216
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,253
so talking to a woman
should blow his mind.

217
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:12,591
And talking to this woman,
it could kill him.

218
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,259
Here, can you look at this map
of a park

219
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,728
and tell me
where them hot birds hang out?

220
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,831
Well, you're gonna want to,
uh, avoid the, uh,

221
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,834
great lawn, because
it's basically just grackles.

222
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,769
- Ugh, grackles?
- Yeah.

223
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,937
(Gina)
I hate grackles.

224
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,842
Well, a lot of people think
grackles are just a common bird

225
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,010
up here,
but you know what?

226
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,112
On the West Coast
they don't get grackles.

227
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,082
Can you give some more info

228
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,518
for a novice bird watcher
such as myself?

229
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,886
You have got to know
the difference

230
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,220
between your water birds.

231
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,222
I mean, so many people
don't know the difference

232
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,957
between an anhinga
and a snake bird

233
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,559
and a swamp hawk.

234
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:51,830
A lot of people don't know
they're all the same bird.

235
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,565
Are those the ones
that sound like Rihanna

236
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,966
kind of when they sing?

237
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,868
I'm not familiar
with who that is.

238
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,172
That sounds like that might be
a crested woodpecker.

239
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,607
Or is it more like...
[whistles]

240
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,976
Well,
that's a crested titmouse maybe?

241
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,745
Oh, my God, that's it.

242
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,848
Wayne, you are
a damn treasure trove.

243
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,317
We got the letter.

244
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,652
Well done.

245
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,955
Now get me Madeline
and a bucket of water.

246
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,324
It's time to melt a witch.

247
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,825
(Rosa)
Who else is going?

248
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,728
Rosa, listen to me,
there is no party.

249
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,263
Just get off my doughnut
already.

250
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:29,568
or you will be eating your bone
marrow custard through a straw.

251
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,136
That's exactly how you're
supposed to eat bone marrow--

252
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,571
- Charles!
- Ah!

253
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,638
All right, there's a party.

254
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,839
I can't give you details.

255
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,107
All I can say is I know you,

256
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,642
and I know you'll have
a good time.

257
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,878
If you knew me, you'd know
I hate surprise parties,

258
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,647
so clearly
you don't know me at all.

259
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,816
What?
We're friends.

260
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,252
I was building up to calling you
"Ro-ro" one of these days.

261
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,753
That will never happen.

262
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,322
In fact, you just lost "Rosa"
privileges.

263
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,624
From now on, you can
call me "Diaz" or "Hey, you."

264
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,125
Come on, Rosa.

265
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,260
Come on, hey, you.

266
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,997
Wow,
champagne and oysters.

267
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,699
You really shouldn't have,
guys.

268
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,367
Well, it's a special night.

269
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,635
So when did you guys meet?

270
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,370
- Last year.
- Five years ago.

271
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,139
We first met five years ago,

272
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,774
but we don't count it,
because...

273
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,310
I was dating a speedboat model
at the time.

274
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,013
And I was dating
a super handsome comptroller

275
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,984
Anyways, about a year ago, we
bumped into each other at a bar,

276
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,886
and we haven't been able to keep
our hands off each other since.

277
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,390
So how did you know
she was the one?

278
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,858
I'd love to answer that.

279
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,627
Um, you know,

280
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,163
just whenever
I look at her face

281
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,667
and the attached physique.

282
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,002
And you?

283
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,770
Uh...

284
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,141
He makes me laugh.

285
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,411
And, you know, there's really
no one else's opinion

286
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,413
who I care about
more than hers, so...

287
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,716
(woman)
Okay, so enough chitchat.

288
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,784
Let's see the ring.

289
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,954
I don't have it on me.

290
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,690
She has gigantic fingers.

291
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,293
What I mean to say
is that the ring I got

292
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,262
would never have fit
on her fingers,

293
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,999
because they are that
of a giant, behemoth person.

294
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,970
[laughter]

295
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,876
Raymond, always a pleasure
to call on a vanquished foe.

296
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,344
I feel like
Jackie Joyner-Kersee

297
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,413
congratulating one
of the other slower runners.

298
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,414
(Terry)
Buckle up.

299
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,115
It's gonna be
a hell of a ride.

300
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,283
(Ray)
Care to sit?

301
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,251
I'm sure
you'd like to take some weight

302
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,686
off your cloven hooves.

303
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,787
Calling me the devil?

304
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:29,954
How original, Raymond.

305
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,390
Actually I was calling
you a goat, you goat.

306
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,260
(both)
Oh.

307
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,995
I'd like to talk
about my promotion.

308
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,196
Very well, but first,

309
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,331
how do I know
you're not wearing a wire?

310
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,700
I need to pat you down.

311
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,835
If you must.

312
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,746
(Terry)
What is going on?

313
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,848
Shh.
I'm watching something.

314
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,850
(man)
Can you get the car
from the valet, babe?

315
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,119
I'm gonna in the back
and say hi to the chef.

316
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,423
Good luck
on your wedding, guys.

317
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,992
Oh, have fun
on your honeymoon.

318
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,261
We will.
We're going to Waco, Texas.

319
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,264
Huh.
Okay, bye.

320
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,899
Bye.

321
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,034
- Waco, Texas?
- I don't know.

322
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,370
All right, well, Augustine took
the laptop case with him.

323
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,172
He's gonna make the drop.
Let's go.

324
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,843
Look, there's the buyer.

325
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,312
Or maybe he's just actually
saying hi to the chef?

326
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,947
Why isn't he making
the handoff?

327
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,148
(Jake)
Oh, crap, he saw us.

328
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,517
Uh,...

329
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,154
Excuse me.

330
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,288
Oh, hey.

331
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,291
We were just looking
for a place to, uh...

332
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,793
Boink.

333
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,361
Yep. Boink.

334
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,064
That's my preferred term
for it as well.

335
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,065
I get it.

336
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,300
Newly engaged kids.
Enjoy.

337
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,870
Thanks.

338
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,140
Good. Good, good, good, good.

339
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,241
We kept our cover intact.
Nice work.

340
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,408
Quick, professional thinking
out there.

341
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,977
Very quick.
Very professional.

342
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,512
- Detective.
- Detective.

343
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,814
- Let's get back on the case.
- Yes.

344
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,854
So how was the restaurant?

345
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,289
Such a normal time!

346
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,558
Why are you being weird?

347
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,793
Amy and I kissed.

348
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,294
What?

349
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,930
To keep our cover from being
blown; we didn't have a choice.

350
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,832
Tell me everything!

351
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,134
(Jake)
Charles, it was just a kiss,
okay?

352
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,569
It was for work.
It was nothing.

353
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,204
Yeah, who cares about a kiss?

354
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,939
Call me if you grab
each other's asses.

355
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,307
He's pulling over.
It's going down.

356
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,142
(Charles)
You guys are so naive.

357
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,579
In high school, I played
Daddy Warbucks in<i> Annie,</i>

358
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,447
Becca Murse played Annie,

359
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,183
and we were supposed
to hug onstage.

360
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,351
And at first,
that seemed like nothing too,

361
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,555
but by opening night,
we were full-on making out.

362
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,856
As Daddy Warbucks and Annie?

363
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,890
Mm-hmm.

364
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,425
The audience was not on board.

365
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,893
Playwright sued the school.

366
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,328
(Rosa)
Guys, guys,
it's not a handoff.

367
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,496
He's leaving the package.

368
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,501
Okay, you and Rosa
follow Augustine.

369
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,436
Right, and you and Amy
follow your hearts.

370
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,305
No, we're gonna stay
with the package.

371
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,439
And each other forever.

372
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,041
Come on, man!

373
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,143
So here's how I see this
going down.

374
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,578
You plead for your job back.
I refuse.

375
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,079
You start weeping
like a war widow.

376
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,314
Does that sound about right?

377
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,383
Don't count
your gross fish babies

378
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,386
before they've hatched,
Madeline.

379
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:23,528
(Gina)
Gina and Terry got it,
you grackle.

380
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,396
(Ray)
It doesn't matter
how I got it.

381
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,900
Sorry, sir, didn't realize that
was how you wanted to play it.

382
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,502
I see you've got an audience
for this little stunt?

383
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,372
Yes, well, who wouldn't want
to see a man fight a crocodile?

384
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:39,043
Now, Madeline, before one of us
starts weeping like a war widow,

385
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,945
would you like to give me
my precinct back?

386
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,581
It's not that simple; I can't
just reverse your promotion.

387
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,651
You have until tomorrow,

388
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,386
you grackle.

389
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,889
(Rosa)
We can't pull him over
this close to the drop site.

390
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,924
It'll alert the buyer.
I say we follow him for a mile.

391
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,426
How's your mom enjoying
the new phone you got her

392
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,095
for her birthday
on March 16th?

393
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,031
Dude, stop saying random facts
to try to prove you know me.

394
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,299
That's not what I'm doing.

395
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,967
I'm simply making small talk
with my friend Rosa,

396
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,002
who went skydiving once.

397
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,005
I'm going to the dumb party
but only because

398
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,139
I don't want to hurt Marcus.

399
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,376
Mm, like how you're still
super mad at<i> Gilmore Girls</i>

400
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:16,381
Oh, I just want to see
Lorelai happy, and shut up!

401
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,251
Ah, see? I knew you so well,
I knew it was co--ah!

402
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,458
Hey, seriously,
we're cool, right?

403
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,060
Yeah, totally.

404
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,995
- We're fine.
- Good.

405
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,599
I never ended up eating
at that dumb fancy restaurant.

406
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,200
You know what I'm getting
on my way home?

407
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,502
Yeah, you're gonna
go to the Polish place

408
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,037
and get perogies,
potato pancakes,

409
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,171
and a cup of hot chocolate.

410
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,006
That's exactly
what I'm gonna get.

411
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,074
Yeah.

412
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,442
I will be having pizza,

413
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,577
two slices
of meat supreme from Tony's,

414
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,379
served display temperature.

415
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,248
Meat supreme
is a million red flags,

416
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,683
and eating it cold
is just insane.

417
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,084
No, no, no.
It's not cold.

418
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,452
- It's display temperature.
- Jake.

419
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,020
There's a difference, Amy.

420
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,056
No, Jake, he's looking at us.

421
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,291
- Well, this is happening.
- Huh?

422
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,400
NYPD! Freeze!
We are police colleagues!

423
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,469
You're under arrest.
This is a work event.

424
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,343
for Augustine
and the buyer?

425
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,610
Sure.

426
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,312
Great.

427
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,382
Man, I forgot how long
your signature takes.

428
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,584
I'm just gonna watch<i> Braveheart</i>
on my phone real quick.

429
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,119
[laughs]

430
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,188
Given the circumstances,

431
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,290
I could see how
that might have seemed like

432
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,624
flirty teasing
or something,

433
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,094
but I was legit
being critical.

434
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,195
You have a problem.

435
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,298
No, even that sounded
like banter now.

436
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,233
All right, there's only one way
out of this for me.

437
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,737
Prepare to have your physical
flaws pointed out, Amy.

438
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,473
I'm talking about your tall butt
and your weird elbows.

439
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,141
Jake, it's okay.

440
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,043
Thank you.

441
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,678
This whole night
was really weird.

442
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,679
I know.

443
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,214
I just...ugh.

444
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,383
I want everything
to go back how it was, you know?

445
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,384
It's so awkward.

446
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,185
- Yeah.
- And you're right.

447
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,055
We shouldn't date cops,
'cause we're a great team.

448
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,556
We work great together.

449
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,724
I don't want to mess that up.

450
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,593
Yeah, I don't want
everything to change.

451
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,727
Yeah, me neither.

452
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:13,531
Okay, then that's that,
Detective Peralta.

453
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,800
Detective Santiago.

454
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,369
See you around the precinct.

455
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,737
Yep.

456
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,773
Tall butt.

457
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,208
Okay, before we go in,

458
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,477
remember you have to pretend
to be surprised.

459
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,579
How's this?
Oh, my God.

460
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,416
It's so much worse
than I imagined.

461
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,484
The energy was great,
but the message was flawed.

462
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,620
All right,
let's get this over with.

463
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,656
Surprise.

464
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,091
What's going on?

465
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,060
I rented this entire bar

466
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,496
so you and I could celebrate
with no people anywhere near us.

467
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,498
I probably should have
hired a bartender, though.

468
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,800
I have no idea
how to make drinks.

469
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,101
This is incredible.

470
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,070
It was all Charles' idea.

471
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,472
I told you I knew you,
Ro-ro.

472
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,742
Thank you.

473
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,111
But never call me "Ro-ro" again.

474
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,212
Oh, but I will.

475
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,680
I've earned this.

476
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,416
Happy b-day,
Ro-ro.

477
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,251
Whoo!

478
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,223
Welcome, Madeline.
Have you thought things over?

479
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,593
I have, but first, how do I
know you're not wearing a wire?

480
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,341
So I've thought it over,
and perhaps you should go ahead

481
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,143
and show that letter
to the commissioner.

482
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,611
And let him fire you?

483
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,846
I'll deny I wrote it.

484
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,781
It will take months
to authenticate,

485
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,216
which will give me
plenty of time

486
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,384
to make some personnel changes
around here.

487
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,386
There's an opening
for a detective

488
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,654
down in Brighton Beach.

489
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,623
I think I'll transfer Diaz
there.

490
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,426
Detective Boyle I'll send
to Long Island City.

491
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,295
Santiago will be a great fit
for Pelham Bay.

492
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,700
And Peralta,
your little pet project,

493
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,870
I'm gonna ship him off
to Staten Island.

494
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:04,375
Hope he likes breaking up
tanning salon fistfights.

495
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,812
Looks like you've got a decision
to make, Raymond.

496
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,647
What are you gonna do?

497
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,783
(Ray)
Squad, if I could have
your attention please?

498
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,854
I am being transferred
to the public relations office.

499
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm leaving the Nine-Nine
effective immediately.

500
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,225
- What the hell?
- I don't understand.

501
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,860
- What the hell?
- Why are you doing this?

502
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,228
What the hell?

503
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,930
I want to say
it has been a pleasure

504
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,667
to have worked alongside all of
you for the past 21 1/2 months.

505
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,636
I'm sorry
for getting so emotional.

506
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,237
A pretty consistent tone,
actually.

507
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,507
These have been the--

508
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,610
these have been the best years
of my career.

509
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,912
Oh, no.
This is new.

510
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:45,716
And I know that everyone of you

511
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:50,354
gave me everything you had,

512
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,656
and I will never forget it.

513
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,357
Go back to being robot captain.

514
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,594
[laughs]
Meep-morp.

515
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,196
Zeet.

516
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,731
[clears throat]
Dismissed.

517
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,740
Sir!

518
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,942
I'm coming with you.

519
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,944
- Thank you, Gina.
- I'm also coming.

520
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,845
Not necessary.

521
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,951
- Hey.
- Hey.

522
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,485
Thought I might find you
in here.

523
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,754
I just needed to process
the captain's news.

524
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,956
I feel so bad for him.

525
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,457
So how are you holding up?

526
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,760
I don't know.
I'm still in shock.

527
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,596
You?

528
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,465
Um, basically handling it the
way I dealt with my dad leaving,

529
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,701
just repressing the hell
out of it.

530
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,973
So a lot of change
around here, huh?

531
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,020
(man)
Hey, Jake,
the new captain's here.

532
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,628
Who do you think
it's gonna be?

533
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,929
(Terry)
I have no idea.

534
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,764
I bet it's me.

535
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,699
I just hope I'm ready.

536
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:09,800
(Rosa)
Wow.

537
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,302
Come on, guys.

538
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:15,273
but let's do our best to make
a good first impression here.

539
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,274
Smart. Good call.

540
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,343
Jake, you be up front.

541
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,012
[elevator bell dings]

542
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,382
Okay, here we go.

543
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,888
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
