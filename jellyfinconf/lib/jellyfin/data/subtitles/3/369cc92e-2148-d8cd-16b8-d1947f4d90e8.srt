is a girl from the gym.

176
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,133
- What?

177
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,935
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about her?

178
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,603
Or that you go to the gym?

179
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,038
Jake, avoid the weights.

180
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,773
Nobody wants you turning
into another Terry.

181
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,425
Ugh.

182
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,076
- Hey, people like
the way that I look.

183
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,412
- Sure they do,
big guy.

184
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:21,713
Look, I can't believe
you're gonna take

185
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,749
some fitness floozy
to Bouche Manger.

186
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,883
You should be going
with Amy.

187
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,017
Right, Amy?

188
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,552
- Uh...
[scoffs]

189
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,820
Whatever, dog.

190
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,422
Date the flooze.

191
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,556
- See?

192
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,692
It's never gonna happen,
Boyle, okay?

193
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,794
Because I find Amy repulsive,

194
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,497
and she finds me
extremely handsome.

195
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,865
So stop pressuring us.

196
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,933
- Oh, you sweet,
naive boy.

197
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,503
I haven't even begun
to pressure you two.

198
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,037
I've already written
my best man speech

199
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,807
for your wedding.

200
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,675
Oh, I'm gonna need you
to get married on a farm.

201
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,412
A lot of my jokes
rely on that.

202
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,748
- So here we are,

203
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,417
officially on a date,

204
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,684
romantical date.

205
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,553
- Yes, we are.

206
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,622
No longer
just colleagues.

207
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,857
Dating.

208
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,859
You got a haircut.
It looks nice.

209
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,461
- Oh, thanks.

210
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,762
You also got a haircut

211
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,631
at some point in your life.

212
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,965
I'm sure that's not
your baby hair.

213
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,000
That would be crazy.

214
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,435
- [chuckles]
- But, uh...

215
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,836
Yeah, you look very nice.

216
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,938
-<i> Domo arigato.</i>

217
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,939
- Do you speak Japanese?

218
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,741
- No.
- Oh.

219
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,843
Uh...sorry.

220
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,579
I think I'm feeling
a little awkward.

221
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,614
- Yeah, me too.

222
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,016
- How do we make it
not weird?

223
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,951
- I know.

224
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,486
Let's just get
super drunk.

225
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,720
- Yes, great idea.

226
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,239
Pardon me, ma'am.

227
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,757
Could you please bring us
four kamikaze shots?

228
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,958
- And four for me
as well.

229
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,660
- Ah, I like your style.

230
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,028
See, we can do this.

231
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,095
We're back on track.

232
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,832
We're keeping it
light and breezy.

233
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,702
So we broke a rule.

234
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,803
- Yeah.

235
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,705
I hope it wasn't
a mistake.

236
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,774
- "I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"
title of your sex tape?

237
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,643
[gasps]
Title of<i> our</i> sex tape.

238
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,647
- So how was the date
with the floozy?

239
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,484
We are not leaving these seats
until you give me some deets.

240
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,786
<i>- All right, fine.</i>

241
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,488
It started off
a bit rocky,

242
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,890
but it ended up
being really fun.

243
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,158
- Did you kiss?

244
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,559
Did you french?

245
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,094
- Boyle, I'm not
gonna answer that.

246
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,563
And no one over the age
of 12 says "french."

247
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,233
- Oh, that's a yes.
Oh, my God, you had sex.

248
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,234
[grunts]

249
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,470
I can tell because
you're glowing.

250
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,705
Ugh, Jake, no one wants
to hear about your sex life.

251
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,507
- You just asked me
repeatedly.

252
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,108
- Because I was rooting
for you and Amy,

253
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,043
but now I can see
you're super serious

254
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,713
about this anonymous
gym seductress.

255
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,648
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.

256
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,916
- It doesn't matter to me.

257
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,551
I'm--I would never date Jake.

258
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,819
I work with Jake.

259
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,086
- I'd love to see you
date someone from work.

260
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,288
Your head would explode.

261
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,257
- Your head would explode...

262
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,826
because of how well
I would handle it.

263
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,661
- Mm. Sick burn.

264
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,097
- Peralta, Dozerman says
he wants to see you.

265
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,699
- Captain,
everything all right?

266
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,769
[tapping]

267
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,606
- You tell me.

268
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,074
According
to your Dozer-pad,

269
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,310
four of your coworkers have
been gathered around your desk

270
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,711
for the last 90 seconds.

271
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,713
Also, someone named
Norm Scully

272
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,749
has been in the bathroom
for the last 72 minutes.

273
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,984
- Oh, yeah, that means
he's about halfway.

274
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,619
But in regards
to the coworkers, sir,

275
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,255
I was telling them I wanted
to get more work done,

276
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,791
but all they wanted to do
was talk about my dating life,

277
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,127
knowing full well
that my true love

278
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,695
is efficiency.

279
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,196
You know my motto, sir.

280
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,265
Cho's before hos.

281
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,900
"Cho's" is "chores."

282
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,637
What?

283
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,657
- I like you.

284
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,041
I could tell from
the moment I walked in here

285
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,643
that we were one
and the same--

286
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,212
detail-oriented,
love crunching numbers.

287
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,714
Bet your apartment's
immaculate.

288
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,848
Could probably eat
off the floor.

289
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,117
- And I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

290
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,020
I'm gonna handle this for you.
- Okay.

291
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,958
- I'm gonna send out
a Dozerblast.

292
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,928
Hey, everyone stop talking
about Peralta's personal life.

293
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,599
Dozerblast over.

294
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,701
- Well, thank you
very much, sir,

295
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,971
and might I just say that
this has been a Dozerblast.

296
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,238
- I saw what you did
right there.

297
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,239
- Uh?

298
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,309
[both laughing]

299
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,713
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

300
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,014
<i>- I know you've been working</i>

301
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,949
on picking a name
for the pigeon mascot

302
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,784
for, uh...
[laughs]

303
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,019
Several months now.

304
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,654
<i>I feel like you might</i>
<i>need a breather,</i>

305
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,323
so I've prepared
an eight-point presentation

306
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,092
on community engagement.

307
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,960
- We'll get to your
presentation, Raymond.

308
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,095
It's on the agenda.

309
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,063
- Well, it says here
it's scheduled

310
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,798
"after everyone leaves."

311
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,283
- And not a minute later.

312
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:36,767
Trent, Bryce, where
are we with the name?

313
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,870
- We've narrowed it down
to two choices--

314
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,405
Petey or Paulie.

315
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,107
<i>- With all due respect,</i>

316
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,643
that pigeon is
clearly a Ray J.

317
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,344
Hi.
Gina Linetti,

318
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,648
the human form
of the 100 emoji.

319
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,750
- I'd like to hear Captain
Holt's thoughts on a name.

320
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,019
- Very well.
My thoughts are...

321
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,053
who cares?

322
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,855
- Give us a name,
Raymond.

323
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,889
Weigh in on this.

324
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,923
It's your job now.

325
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,659
- No.

326
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,127
- A name.

327
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,795
Petey or Paulie,
which is it?

328
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,929
- What does it matter?

329
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,131
Why'd you even choose
a pigeon anyway?

330
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,298
It's a terrible mascot.

331
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,833
- Because they're
a staple of New York,

332
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,702
they're nonthreatening,
and they're everywhere.

333
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,903
- They're carriers of disease,

334
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,772
and they eat garbage!

335
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,140
- Name the pigeon,
Raymond!

336
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,742
- You can't make me.
<i>- I can make you, and I will.</i>

337
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,944
Name the pigeon.
That's an order!

338
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,252
- Paulie.

339
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,286
- Thank you.

340
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,320
Was that so hard?

341
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,389
- [sighs]

342
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,224
- Yeah, I'm trying
to find some evidence.

343
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,026
I'm just gonna
look in here.

344
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,895
Another perfect cover.
Two for two. Nailed it.

345
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,296
All right,
I talked to Dozerman

346
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,732
and convinced him to outlaw
all personal talk at work.

347
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,766
We're in the clear.

348
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,034
- And everyone
hates you for that,

349
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,837
but this is totally working,
and no one knows.

350
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,105
- I know.
It's the best.

351
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,406
And you know what?
I'm glad we broke the rule

352
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,874
and had sex
on the first date.

353
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,210
- Me too, 'cause we're,
like, really good at it.

354
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,045
- So good, right?
- Stupid good.

355
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,280
- It makes no sense.
- [gasps]

356
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,748
- We're light
and breezy.

357
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,349
If we want to break rules,
break rules.

358
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,018
Like, what's another
rule we could break?

359
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,753
- No making out at work.

360
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,988
- Okay, that's
very flattering, Amy,

361
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,458
but there are some rules
that I shall never--

362
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,426
- Let's go.
- Okay.

- Nothing--you were just
making out with Peralta.

00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,994
- Ah, there's that candy bar
wrapper I was looking for.

Oh, Santiago,
what are you doing here?

Now I understand why nothing
gets done in this precinct.

00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,338
The detectives are too busy
frenching with each other,

385

- What happened
in there?

402
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,810
- Nothing.
We were just working,

403
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,495
separately.

404
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,179

just came in and died.

405
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,247
- Peacefully,

to be startled?

Nope. Uh...

- He might have
been startled

412
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,459
by how far apart
we were standing.

413
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,161
- That seems unlikely,

414
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,064
but obviously he had
a ton of health problems,

415
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,033

pretty open and shut.

Do me a favor and pull
the surveillance tapes.

417
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,871
- Right,
the surveillance tapes.

418
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,440
- Yep, because this is
a police precinct.

419
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,243

to tell me?

420

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,448

Oh!

425
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,254
Wait.
What about the gym floozy?

426
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,122
Amy was the gym floozy.

427
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,024

Oh, I am over the moon.

431
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,431

432
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,666
Casual? Serious?

433
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,900
I need to know
how to make fun of you.

434
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,901
You guys dating?

435
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,902
- Yes.
- No.

436
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,003
- Oh, that's not good.

437
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,137
- I mean, yes.

438
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,339
I just said no
because of the rules.

439
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,573
We said we weren't
gonna tell anyone.

440
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,908

441
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,176
and we're still
figuring it out.

442
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,978
- Enough.
Look.

443
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,913
Terry loves love,

444
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,583
but Terry also loves maintaining
a professional work environment.

445
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,285
As your commanding officer,

446
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,121
I am very disappointed
in both of you.

447
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,160
- So, Boyle...
- Mm.

448
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,563
- Let's go look at those
surveillance tapes, yeah?

449
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,200
- Oh, absolutely.
- Mm.

450
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,303
- Captain, I know this
isn't my place to say,

451
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,238
but Madeline Wuntch
is here to see you.

452
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,040
- Actually that's exactly
your place to say.

453
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,441
You are my assistant.

454
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,977
What precisely did you
think your job was?

455
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,179
- Ideally?
Bullfighter.

456
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,948
But it's such a boys' club.

457
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,917
- Hmm.
- Ooh.

458
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,618
I like what you've done
with your office, Raymond.

459
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,837
It's cozy,

460
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,055
like a shoebox one buries
a dead hamster in.

461
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,091
So what did you want
to see me about?

462
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,993
- I'd like
to propose a truce.

463
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,161
Our feud is
getting in the way

464
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,496
of the NYPD's business.

465
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,665
Madeline, the PR
department is a joke.

466
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,300
Their work here
is meaningless.

467
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,602
Nine weeks to choose
the name Paulie.

468
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,704
I knew instantly
it should be Pepper,

469
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,706
Officer Pepper O'Pigeon.

470
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,608
- Maybe we should start
the whole naming process

471
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,243
all over again.

472
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,578
- I could turn this department
around if you'd let me.

473
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
You're wasting my talents.

474
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,515
- This man is a Timberlake,

475
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,984
and you need to stop
treating him like a Fatone.

476
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,987
- Yes, yes,
perhaps you're right.

477
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,056
Perhaps I am wasting
your talents.

478
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,626
I want you to spread
your wings, as it were.

479
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,695
I think we've found
the perfect person

480
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,296
to wear the pigeon costume.

481
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,165
It's you, Raymond.

482
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,100
Do we need to get
the costume altered,

483
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,601
or do you have
your own pigeon pants?

484
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:15,106
- No, Madeline, I don't
have my own pigeon pants.

with that stupid game, Sarge?

490
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,517

491
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,720

00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,291
I just realized I'm never gonna
be able to say that to his face.

495
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,160
I mean, I could say it
to his wife at the funeral,

496
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,579
but it won't be the same.

497
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,997

our precinct better.

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,431
Look. Holt's gone.

00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,499

Who knows who we're
getting next?

00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,502
I'm just trying to keep
this place running.

I mean,

- Hey, so everybody
knows about us now,

508
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,582
which means all the rules
have been broken

509
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,616
and nothing bad happened.

510
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,118
- Nothing bad happened?

511
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,553
Terry yelled at us,
and we killed our captain.

00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,490
Jake, is this a bad idea?

513
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,458
It seems like the universe
is sending us a lot of signs

00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,726
that we should
hit the brakes.

515
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,728

it hasn't started out great.

00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,703
- What do you want
to do, then?

520
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,705
Go back to being colleagues?
