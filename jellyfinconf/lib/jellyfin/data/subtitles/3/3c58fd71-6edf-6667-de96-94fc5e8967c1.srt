145
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,009
               It's really good.

146
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,978
- Hm, none for Soren.

147
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,946
He's allergic to lactose,
gluten, and tomato ketchup.

148
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,748
             - Oh.
    - Also, none for Agneta.

149
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,915
      She and her husband
           are trying

150
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,284
     to have another baby,

151
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,285
          so she can't
          eat anything

152
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,020
        that will alter
        her cervical pH.

153
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,321
                           - Oh.

154
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,006
         - You guys are
        real close, huh?

155
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,690
    - In Sweden, we believe
 for a proper team to function,

156
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,893
partners must be completely open
        with each other.

157
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,728
- Yeah.
We have no secrets.

158
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,963
Not even our bodies.

159
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,564
We sauna together
all the time.

160
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,566
                   - Yeah, well,
         we are also very close.

161
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,402
           One time, Rosa saw me
             in my bathing suit.

162
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,803
    - No, I didn't, you told
       me to turn around.

163
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,571
            - Yeah.
- Well, uh, since we cannot eat

164
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,206
your disgusting street food,

165
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,840
could you please check if our
prisoner has been processed?

166
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,543
     - Yeah, we don't mean
      to offend, it's just

167
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,645
  this place is filthy and you
   both seem unprofessional.

168
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,147
               - Unprofessional?

169
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,648
             Well, we were going
     to take you to our favorite

170
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,483
       laser tag place, but now,

171
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,319
    you're officially uninvited.

172
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,688
                           Rosa.

173
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,723
   - Ah, Boyle. Just the man
      we were looking for.

174
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,425
       Kevin has accepted
     a fellowship to teach

175
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,859
        at the Sorbonne
    for the next six months.

176
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,561
             - Oh, I love Paris.

177
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:30,729
                    At least how
                it's represented

178
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,531
                    in the movie
                  "Ratatouille."

179
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,433
            - Uh...
       - The rodent chef.

180
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,834
- Ah, yes.
Farfetched.

181
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,436
  - Anyway, Kevin and I belong

182
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,705
to the Park Slope Racquet Club,
    where we've established

183
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,540
   a squash doubles dynasty.

184
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,809
- We've taken home the trophy
two years in a row.

185
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,811
Unfortunately, I'll be flying
to Paris this year

186
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:46,945
during the tournament.

187
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,780
   It's a seven-hour flight.
          - [whistles]

188
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,849
    - I remember you told me
     you played in college.

189
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,552
         - Three-time intramural
     champion at Sarah Lawrence.

190
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,721
       Would have been four, but
 senior year I played Greaseball

191
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,823
      in our school's production
         of "Starlight Express."

192
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,524
- Interesting casting.

193
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,693
In any case, I would be honored
if you would take my place

194
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,428
so that Raymond
could make it a treble.

195
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,897
                   - Absolutely!
        I would love to do that!

196
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,366
            - Great.
         <i> - Formidable.</i>

197
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,400
                          - Yup!

198
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,902
                  That is great.
                  This is great.

199
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,971
       This is terrible.
             - Why?

200
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,973
You always said you wanted
more face time with Holt.

201
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,491
            - No, not like this.

202
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,008
               Squash brings out
            my competitive side.

203
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,912
     breaking racquets, cursing,
              excessive mooning.

204
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,714
               One time, just to
                psych a guy out,

205
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,684
          I locked eyes with him
          and ate a squash ball.

206
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,685
- That's not possible.

207
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,587
      - It's still in me, Terry.

208
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,455
- Look, the point
is to have fun.

209
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,790
So just relax
and have fun.

210
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:32,991
                 - Right, right,
                    right, yeah.

211
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,059
               It's just a game.

212
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,527
                       It's fun.

213
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,896
                 There's no need
              for Holt to see me

214
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,564
              unleash the beast.

215
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,401
                        [laughs]
                           Okay.

216
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,703
       - That's a strange
          little man.

217
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,171
 - Probably telling Captain Holt
              how much they like

218
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,907
       to sauna together.
           - Please.

219
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,941
They think they're so great
just 'cause

220
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,009
they know
each other's allergies.

221
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,177
You know
what I'm allergic to?

222
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,612
          - Yup. Them.
           - Totally.

223
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,714
And also bees.
You should know that.

224
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,682
If I got stung by a bee,
I could die.

225
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,117
- Detectives, I've been talking
      with the inspectors.

226
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,053
   There's been a development
 in the Kottbullediamant case.

227
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,588
   - Excellent pronunciation,
            Captain.

228
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,023
            - Tack.
     They believe our perp

229
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,375
     may have smuggled more

230
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,726
    stolen Swedish diamonds
         into Brooklyn.

231
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,027
- Oh, well,
thank you for the tip.

232
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,595
Have a wonderful flight home.

233
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,631
We will send you the jewels
as soon as we find them.

234
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,000
     - They're staying and
   working the case with you.

235
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,802
- Ah, fantastic.

236
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,104
Rosa, could you please fill
my car with a million bees?

237
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,942
- Okay, since the Swedes
are rudely late,

238
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,510
let's talk
anniversary gift.

239
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,913
Should I get Amy something
caszh like shot glasses,

240
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,883
or something less caszh,
like golden shot glasses?

241
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,452
             - Still don't care.
          How about I get a jump

242
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,554
             on our new partners
and search the perp's apartment?

243
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,856
- Right. We'll get some
clues, solve the case,

244
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,957
make them look like fools.

245
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,158
They can eat our
American dust.

246
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,094
                       - No, no.

247
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,029
               Soren is probably
               allergic to dust.

248
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,030
          - Oh, hello!

249
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,798
       Yes, I am allergic
            to dust.

250
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,799
                  - Everyone is.

251
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,834
        That's what sneezes are.

252
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,835
      - You're what sneezes are.

253
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,036
- Okay.
[clears throat]

254
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,504
What are you guys
doing here?

255
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,072
                - Oh, in Sweden,
         we call it police work.

256
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,807
               Perhaps you don't
             have a word for it?

257
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,676
    - [whispers] I hate you.
      - This is our case.

258
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,111
               You can't work it
                     without us.

259
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,545
                 Get your weird,
     hairless fingers off of it.

260
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,547
      - Soren shaves his fingers
                    for cycling.

261
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,782
           It cuts down on drag.

262
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,050
         - Agneta is my
        biggest fanatic.

263
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,719
     Just as I am a fanatic
      of her slam poetry.

264
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,788
  Would you like to hear some?
       - Would I like to?

265
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,790
        I would hate to!
          - Your loss.

266
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,825
  Well, we've already searched
     the entire apartment.

267
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,627
- Yeah, well,
now we're gonna search it,

268
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,497
and find things you all missed,
like this!

269
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,531
        - Your own keys?

270
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,532
- Damn straight.

271
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,067
Bag 'em, Diaz.

272
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,134
          [keys thud]

273
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,972
             - Astronomy is full
           of interesting facts.

274
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,673
                   For instance,
                 here's one that

275
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,942
               Hollywood doesn't
               want you to know.

276
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,013
            A parsec is actually
          a measure of distance.

277
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,649
    One of the many inaccuracies
    in the "Star Wars" universe.

278
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,785
- Uh-huh.
And what's "Star Wars"?

279
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,953
                      - Oh, boy.

280
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,788
         Maybe I'm getting ahead
                      of myself.

281
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,191
       Okay, let's talk planets.

282
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,827
         Jupiter is a gas giant.

283
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,828
- So is Hitchcock.

284
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,862
How does this help me?

285
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,998
         - It also has 67 moons.

286
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,799
                  I came up with
           a fun mnemonic device

287
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,800
           to remember them all.

00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,323
- She told me you called me
a gas giant.

297
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,326
Well, now you and I
will never hook up.

298
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,297
                        - Uh-oh.

00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,932

             A shipping manifest

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,802

                    of a drawer.

   we cracked the case wide open

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080

                I speak Spanish.

318
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,695

            - Yeah.

319
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,331
                   - Oh, that...
            Alvar Gooz-hev-vren.

320
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,333
         Well, you're welcome to
       pursue that dead-end lead

321
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,768
    while we got to the shipping
  container and find the jewels.

322
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,236

     please do not do that.

325
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,941
               - Yeah, obviously
                    we wouldn't.

326
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,109
       We were just being jerks.

327
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,777
           See you later, jerks.

328
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,813
            - Okay.
    - Bye, Jake. Bye, Rosie.

You ready, Boyle?

330
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,252
          Psyched up?
           - No, why?

331
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,320
              Do I seem psyched?

332

00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,441
         - And to win.

335
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,225

    and don't throw any racquets

336
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,329
     and don't eat squash balls,
         then we're all winners.

373
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,208

talk about that crap.

00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,141
We're not lame
like the Swedes.

392
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,175
                        - Right.

393
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,111
                  Yeah, totally.

394
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,046
     If Agneta broke up with her
 husband, she'd probably be all,

395
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,814
                     "Oh, Soren,
           I am so heartbroken,"

396
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:30,915
               and he'd be like,

397
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,383
         "What can I do to help?
                     I'm sorry,"

398
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,385
      and give her a big old hug
                and she'd be all

00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,520
                  feeling better
                  like an idiot.

400
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,972
- We don't need
to do that

401
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,423
because what we do together
is solve crimes.

402
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,791
                  - You know it.

        It's fish, Rosa!

              Hey, this is weird
