1
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,536
       - Ooh! Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,155
      You got to see this.

3
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:07,773
               I'm about to give
          Captain Holt his gift.

4
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,242
- Oh, did he lift
his "no gift" policy?

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,894
                - No, he didn't.

6
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:13,545
         But I figured out a way
            to buy him something

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,547
                   and trick him
              into accepting it.

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,750
         - You are bad.
        - I know, right?

9
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:19,318
                       Oh, wait.
        You're making fun of me.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,786
           - Mm-hmm.
     - Well, I don't care.

11
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,488
     He would never open a gift,
                          right?

12
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,224
            But what if his gift
        didn't look like a gift?

13
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,092
      - He would open it?
           - Exactly!

14
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,261
    I left it in a cardboard box
                    on his desk.

15
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,463
                There's no card,
      just the words "Open now,"

16
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,065
which I wrote with my wrong hand

17
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,734
        so he wouldn't recognize
                 my handwriting.

18
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,069
            Captain.
      - Santiago. Peralta.

19
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,070
             - Sir.

20
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,438
       So just to recap,

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,774
  you left an unmarked package
   on a police captain's desk

22
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,776
      on a random Monday,
   with a suspicious message

23
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:44,777
 written on it that looked like

24
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,178
        it was scrawled
       by a crazy person.

25
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,180
           - Mm-hmm.
    - Bomb! There's a bomb!

26
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,181
         Everyone out!
      Let's go, let's go!

27
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,483

      This is not a drill!

28
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,652
           Let's go!

29
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,055
      - Great gift, babe.

32
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,111
             - Ho, ho, ho, Jake.

33
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:21,413
                Special delivery
               from Santa's elf.

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,681
                Merry Christmas.

35
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,283
- Ah.

[gasps]

37
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,187
      - Heart Attack soda.
- Holy crap! I love this stuff!

38
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,289
You know, technically,
it's just carbonated fudge.

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,340
           - I know.
  - I thought they banned it.

40
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,390
                 - Not in Syria.

41
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,426
     They use it to induce labor

               arrives tomorrow.

43
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,831
- There's more?
Charles, this is too much.

44
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,265
                     - Nonsense!

45
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,733
       It was just a lot of time
             and a lot of money.

46
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,335
- Oh.

47
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,438
             Gina!
         I screwed up.

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,673
        I forgot to get
       Charles anything.

49
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,741
- Oh, well, I always knew
he would die of sadness.

50
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,176
      - I'm such a selfish jerk.

51
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,578
           I was just so focused
                   on Amy's gift

52
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,963
       that I completely spaced.

53
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:55,347
           His present to me was
                    so personal.

54
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,382
               All right, think.
         What does Charles love?

55
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,718
          Gross food, tan pants,
            "MasterChef Junior."

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,286
            Ooh, I could call up
               one of those kids

57
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,521
      and offer them a free trip
                    to New York.

58
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,555
- I wouldn't do that.

59
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,756
 - Right, 'cause I'm a stranger,

60
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,225
  and I shouldn't be luring them
                   out of state.

61
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,693
           Good call.
 - Jake, just go to Goodwin's.

62
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,495
They're open late,
and they have everything.

63
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,430
                 - Right. Smart.
            Please come with me.

64
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,082
             Please, I need help
          picking something out.

65
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,733
                   Please, Gina?

66
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,535
    I'll take a pic of Terry
  in the locker room for you.

67
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,738
- No towel, with his foot up
on the bench.

68
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,673
           - Towel on, still wet
                from the shower.

69
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,841
- I'm in.

70
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,909
                    - Hey, guys.
                      What's up?

71
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,145
         both: Nothing.

72
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,415
    - Diaz, are we still on
for the Polar Bear Swim tonight?

73
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,750
    - It's either that or go
    caroling with my family,

74
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,152
           so, yeah.

75
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,253
      I'd rather walk into
      the freezing ocean.

00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,320
                   - Wait, what?

77
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,355
       You guys are doing
        the polar swim?

78
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,589
     Why didn't you ask me?

79
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,690
- Oh, we didn't think
you'd be interested.

80
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,192
  - Yeah, you're always cold.

81
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,427
     You brought a blanket
  to a Mets game in mid-July.

82
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:46,698
      - [scoffs] This one thinks
          July 18th is mid-July.

83
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,636
    You guys think I'm some kind
           of wimp, but I'm not.

84
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,905
     I am tough, and I'm strong,

85
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,940
     and I love to splash around
                in chilly water.

86
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,808
       - It's not chilly,
          it's as cold

87
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,811
   as the waters of Cocytus,
    the frozen lake of hell.

88
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,480
           - I'll see you there.

89
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,315
   I can't wait to dunk my junk.

91
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,287
         - Okay, gang.
            I'm out.

92
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,655
   I'll be back on the 27th.

93
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,690
       I've got two days
        of family time.

 Do not attempt to contact me.

95
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,527
     I do not want a repeat
          of last year

96
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,930
 when Scully called me 50 times
     on Christmas morning.

97
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,898
             - No.
       I called you once.

98
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
  My butt called the other 49.

99
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,569
- Yeah, well, my brother-in-law
      Zeke was real judgy

100
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,305
         about how much
     my phone was buzzing.

       Barbara Corcoran?

104
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,717
    - He didn't even make me
    one of the good sharks.

105
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,952
       I'm clearly Lori.

106
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,721
        Nobody call me.

107
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,323
            - Gina!

108
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,392
It's our first annual
Boyle-Linetti Christmas.

109
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,728
Are you excited about going
to town on Daddy's nog?

110
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,930
       - Christmas is cancelled.
              Charles ruined it.

111
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:52,998
     I'm gonna be a little late.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,433
              I got to help Jake
               do some shopping.

113
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,535
- Oh, last-minute gifts.

114
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,437
Ooh, who didn't make the cut?

115
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,974
Tell me, Jake, who's the poor
sack at the bottom of your list?

116
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,611
- Actually, Amy.

117
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:09,615
    - Amy? Oof! That's bad.
           - Mm-hmm.

118
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,250
        - Just give her
      whatever you got me.

119
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,417
           - Really?

120
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,020
    But then I wouldn't have
        a gift for you.

121
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,021
  Would you be cool with that?

122
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,756
- No, that would eviscerate me.

123
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,991
       I'll get my coat.

124
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,626
       I'm gonna help you
    find something for her.

125
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,928
  - Oh, that's not necessary.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, Jake.

126
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,863
      - Also not necessary
       to touch my face.

127
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,633
               - It's Christmas.
          A time for friendship.

128
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,800
- Damn it.
All right.

129
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,002
I guess you'll just
have to distract him

130
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,570
   when we get to the store.
            - On it.

131
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,005
     I'll take him to housewares
                and I'll ask him

132
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,474
the difference between a skillet
               and a frying pan.

133
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,376
   That'll buy you six hours.
           - Perfect.

134
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,944
Gina, you just saved Christmas.

135
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,413
               - It's what I do.

136
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,682
                Every damn year.

137
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,750
         - Good night.
         - Good night.

138
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,587
  - Wait! No, no, no, no, no!
      Don't lock the door!

139
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,622
 I just need to buy one thing.
        I'll be so fast,

140
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,723

00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,497
Jake wants to go solo, and he's
trying to steal my thunder.

362
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,066
   - He's inside and he has eyes
               on the situation.

363
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,769

That sniper?

366
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,308
He'll shoot whoever
I tell him to.

00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,309
Even you.

368
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,811

00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,547
Then, uh, he'll sit
on any rooftop I tell him to.

Hey, go sit on
that rooftop, guy.

371
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,085

                       a chance.

372
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,254
       If he fails, then you can
             storm the building.

373
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,089
- I'll give him a chance
to sit on his little white butt

374
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,791

to come rescue him.

375

and he's my hot,
dumb daughter.

377
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,863
- All right, we're outnumbered
and unarmed.

378
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,198
If we're gonna get Gina back,
we need weapons.

379

This place sells
hammers, wrenches--

380
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,168
          - Do they sell plants?

381
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,804
            Because some of that
      potting soil is very toxic

382
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,038
if ingested in large quantities.

383
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,008
- So you want to feed
the bad guys a lot of soil?

384
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,109
               - Force-feed 'em.

385

00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,302
     I couldn't find the cologne
         you wanted to give Amy,

567
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,971
                   but I did get
        a Canyon Stank gift set.

568
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,241
          It's all three stanks,
            plus the body spray.

569
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,544
  - Oh, wow. Thanks, Charles.
            - Yeah.

570
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,647
- Look, I didn't forget
Amy's gift.

571
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,783
I forgot yours.

572
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,518
The Canyon Stank was for you.

573
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,454
                         - What?
    Why didn't you just tell me?

574
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,822
       Oh, because it would have
                crushed my heart

575
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,923
      and ruined our friendship.

576
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,725
                      Good call.

577
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,526
- Look, it sucks,
and I was selfish.

578
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,661
I should have gotten you
something better.

579
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,729
                      - You did.

580
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,864
        You surrendered yourself
                to keep me safe.

581
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,968
   Not only that, you sacrificed
       your John McClane moment.

582
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,670
 It should have been you saying,
  "Yippie kayak, other buckets!"

583
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,739
- Ah, I know you have
the moral high ground right now,

584
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,807
but it still makes me so angry.

585
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,841
                           - Eh.

586
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,611
- Anyways,
Merry Christmas, buddy.

587
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,745
               - You too, buddy.
