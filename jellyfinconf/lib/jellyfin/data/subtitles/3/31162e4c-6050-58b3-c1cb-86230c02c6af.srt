1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:04,055
This job is eating me alive.

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:06,246
<i>I can't breathe anymore.</i>

3
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:09,511
<i>I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.</i>

4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,242
<i>The man in the white hat.</i>

5
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,269
I'm not becoming like them.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,206
I am them.

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,361
Hey! What are
you doing, weirdo?

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,402
I'm doing the best speech
from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

9
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,694
Or, actually...

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,924
Ten of me are doing the best
speech from <i>Donnie Brasco.</i>

11
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:27,386
What's up?

12
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,925
Get it together, man.
Okay?

13
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:31,317
So, the store was hit
about two hours ago.

14
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:34,317
They took mostly tablets,
laptops, and cameras.

15
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:38,970
Sorry.

16
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:43,196
I'd like a list of all your employees
who ever had access to the store.

17
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,328
I'd also like to apologize
for my partner.

18
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:46,766
His parents didn't
give him enough attention.

19
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,025
Uh... Detective?

20
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:49,360
I already solved the case.

21
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,779
We're looking for three white males, one
of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.

22
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:54,456
And how do you know that?

23
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,183
I had an informant
on the inside.

24
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,118
He's been here for years.

25
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,844
Watching, learning, waiting...

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,578
His code name...

27
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,277
Fuzzy Cuddle Bear.

28
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,168
He's a nanny cam.

29
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:09,001
Ugh! You got lucky.

30
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,697
No, I got here
five minutes before you

31
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,631
and figured that in this
gigantic electronics store

32
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,665
there had to be at least
one working camera.

33
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:16,720
Oh! Hi, bad guys.

34
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,251
You did it, Fuzzy.
You busted 'em.

35
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:20,988
It's time to come home.

36
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,246
I'm not sure if I can.

37
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,542
I've been undercover so long,

38
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:25,845
I've forgotten who I am.

39
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:28,013
I've seen terrible things.

40
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,635
I haven't known the touch
of a woman in many moons.

41
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,902
All right.

42
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,468
Detective Santiago?

43
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,065
Don't walk away from me!

44
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:49,485
Yes, I did crack the case.

45
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,944
So, Santiago,
would you do the honors?

46
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,433
- I hate this.
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:02,264
I hate this. And you're
just gonna wanna add one.

48
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,527
I'm winning!

49
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,552
It's a good feeling. It's
a good feeling. Yeah.

50
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,649
Enjoy it while it lasts.

51
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:10,884
I will.

52
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,685
J.P., update on the
Morgenthau murder?

53
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,944
Yeah. Good news for
all you murder fans.

54
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:20,201
Earlier this morning, someone
decided to shoot and kill

55
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:22,442
luxury food importer,
Henry Morgenthau.

56
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,735
Body was found by
the cleaning lady.

57
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:27,633
During her interview, I deduced
using expert detective work,

58
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:29,893
that she had something
super gross on her chin.

59
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,953
I think it was flan.

60
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,718
Charles thinks it was flan. I think
it was butterscotch pudding.

61
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,221
Maybe it was just old
person gunk.

62
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,946
You know how old people always
have that gunk on them?

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,174
Oldie gunk. Could be.
Yeah. Anyone else?

64
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,976
How about we focus
on the murder,

65
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,672
and not the old person gunk?

66
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,040
Crime techs are
at the scene now.

67
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,268
We're heading back
when they're done.

68
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:48,773
Okay.
I want you on this.

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,804
It's gonna be priority one
for the new CO.

70
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,272
Wait. Tell us about
the new captain.

71
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,643
Captain Holt will be here soon.

72
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,291
He'll want to introduce himself.

73
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:56,421
Dismissed.

74
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,984
Hey, Gina,
you know any scalpers?

75
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,014
I wanna ask Rosa to go to the
Rihanna concert with me,

76
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,141
but it's sold out.

77
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,477
Okay, two points to make here.

78
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:09,569
First, Rihanna?

79
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,372
You...
And then Rihanna.

80
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,939
Yeah. What's your second point?

81
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:16,595
She's got a type,

82
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,566
which is really anyone but you.

83
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah, that was my
ex-wife's type, too.

84
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:24,318
Look, a Rihanna concert
is a pretty big swing, man.

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,782
I don't know.

86
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,379
She's into watching old movies.

87
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,478
Cool!

88
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,347
Where would I find a place
that shows old movies?

89
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,347
Oh, yeah. Just go
on the Internet

90
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,572
and search for the phrase,

91
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,109
"I want to buy two movie tickets"

92
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,457
"for a girl
who doesn't like me."

93
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:41,099
Great. Thank you.
Good.

94
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,403
Hey, have you heard anything
about the new captain?

95
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,124
Uh, no, and I don't care.

96
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,112
I just wish Captain McGintley never left.
He was the best.

97
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,822
He was terrible.

98
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:53,252
You just liked him 'cause he let
you do anything you wanted.

99
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,111
On your marks, get set...

100
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,240
Go.

101
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:00,046
What the hell's goin' on
around here?

102
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,201
Fire extinguisher
roller chair derby.

103
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,499
Okay.

104
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,733
And go!

105
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,187
What's your point?

106
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,727
If I'm ever gonna make
captain, I need a good mentor.

107
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:15,951
I need my rabbi.

108
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:19,351
Sorry, dude. But this new guy's gonna
be another washed-up pencil pusher,

109
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:20,509
who's only concerned with

110
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:23,673
Following every rule
in the Patrol Guide.

111
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,212
Meep morp zeep!

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,300
Robot captain engage.

113
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,533
- Is that what you think?
- Hey!

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,260
New captain alert.

115
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:33,826
You must be the new CO.

116
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,922
I'm Detective Jake Peralta.
Great to meet you.

117
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,055
No, don't let me interrupt you.

118
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,822
You were describing what
kind of person I'm gonna be.

119
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,257
I'd like you to finish.

120
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,588
It's not necessary.

121
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:48,146
Or I could recap very quickly.
Sure. Um, let's see.

122
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:51,041
I think I said some joke about

123
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:52,440
being a washed-up
pencil-pusher.

124
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,134
Now do the robot voice.

125
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,366
The robot voice you were doing when you
implied I'm a rule-following robot.

126
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,900
I wanna hear it again.

127
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,890
Meep, morp, zarp.

128
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,516
Robot.

129
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,981
- That's a terrible robot voice.
- Yep.

130
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:14,071
The next time I see you, I'd like
you to be wearing a necktie.

131
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,703
Oh, uh, actually,

132
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,675
the last captain
didn't care if we wore ties.

133
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,173
Well, your new captain does.

134
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:22,465
And more importantly, he cares
that you follow his direct orders.

135
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,727
Everyone.

136
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,264
I'm your new Commanding
Officer, Captain Ray Holt.

137
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:27,520
Speech!

138
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:28,619
That was my speech.

139
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:29,955
Short and sweet.

140
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,050
Sergeant Jeffords.
A word.

141
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,546
Yes, sir.

142
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,015
I love that guy.
Same.

143
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,813
He's so suave.

144
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,306
Does anyone get a little
bit of a gay vibe?

145
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,800
No? Okay.

146
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:48,133
Sergeant, you were in
the One-Eight with me.

147
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,757
Though you were significantly...

148
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,253
Fatter, sir. They called
me Terry Titties.

149
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,015
Because I had large, uh...

150
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,083
Titties.
Yes. I remember.

151
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,676
I never liked that nickname.

152
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,614
Though to be fair,
it was accurate.

153
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:05,279
What's this I hear about you
being on administrative leave?

154
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:08,740
A year ago, my wife and I
had twin baby girls, uh...

155
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,032
Cagney and Lacey.

156
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,131
They have adorable
chubby cheeks.

157
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:15,927
Ever since, I kinda
got scared of getting hurt.

158
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,333
Lost my edge.

159
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,518
There was an incident
in a department store.

160
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,281
Hey, man. You okay?
You look a little jumpy.

161
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,881
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

162
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:29,905
ReEncoded By Dr.XJ | PSA
www.PSArips.com

163
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,403
I think he's dead.

164
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,537
And I'm still not right.

165
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:38,032
Tell me about your
detective squad.

166
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,863
Um, well...

167
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,591
Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.

168
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,091
They're pretty much worthless.

169
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,593
But they make good coffee.

170
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,886
Copy that.

171
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:48,783
Now the good ones.

172
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:52,673
Rosa Diaz. Tough,
smart, hard to read,

173
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:54,271
and really scary.

174
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:57,613
Tell me who has me
for Secret Santa.

175
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,798
No! That takes all
the fun out of it.

176
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:02,665
It's Scully.

177
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,759
He got you a scarf.

178
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:04,858
I'll make him return it.

179
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,024
Yes, you will.

180
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:08,621
Charles Boyle.

181
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:10,422
He's a grinder. Not the
most brilliant detective,

182
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:12,616
but he works harder
than anyone else.

183
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,155
He's not physically

184
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:15,776
gifted.

185
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,907
Aw, man!
My muffin!

186
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:20,371
Ah!

187
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,177
Ow, my head!

188
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,301
My muffin and my head!

189
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,033
And I stepped on... On my muffin,
and my head and my muffin.

190
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,235
Amy Santiago.

191
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,195
She's got seven brothers.

192
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:32,094
So she's always trying
to prove she's tough.

193
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,552
Be careful.
That stuff's pretty hot.

194
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:36,648
Oh, is it? Hmm?

195
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:50,768
She and Peralta have some big bet
over who gets more arrests this year.

196
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:53,559
Ever since the bet, their
numbers have gone way up.

197
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:55,691
Tell me about Peralta.

198
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,128
Jacob Peralta is
my best detective.

199
00:07:58,198 --> 00:08:01,024
He likes putting away bad guys
and he loves solving puzzles.

200
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,182
The only puzzle he hasn't solved

201
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,415
is how to grow up.

202
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,746
That was very well put.

203
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,205
I've talked a lot about
Jake in my

204
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,404
departmentally-mandated
therapy sessions.

205
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,173
Look, you know my history.

206
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:15,834
You know how important
this is to me.

207
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:17,065
This precinct is doing fine.

208
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,465
But I want to make it
the best one in Brooklyn.

209
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,092
And I need your help.

210
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,658
Absolutely, sir.

211
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,224
Where do we start?

212
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,352
What is happening?

213
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,847
We start with him.

214
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,078
Okay. So the perp came in through the
window, left the muddy red footprint,

215
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:39,007
and apparently had sex
with the dish rack.

216
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:40,639
Shell casings found here.

217
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,729
Two shots.

218
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,599
Bang, bang.
Great work, Detective.

219
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,099
You get a tie.
Hey, that's mine.

220
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,167
You took it from my desk.

221
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,287
That's right, Charles.
Good solve. Tie for you.

222
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,644
Thanks! Now everyone be sure
to put those on, because it's

223
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,451
impossible to solve crimes
unless you're wearing a tie.

224
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:55,817
Lay off the Captain.

225
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,283
That man is gonna be my rabbi.

226
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,111
Okay, first of all, when
you use the word rabbi,

227
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:01,510
you know that turns me on. And that's
unfair in the work environment.

228
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:04,335
Secondly, your rabbi
is a pain in my ass.

229
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,964
Yeah, he's a little too serious.
What do you think, Rosa?

230
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:09,032
Seems cool. Yeah, seems cool.
I agree.

231
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:10,699
Looks like the perp stole

232
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,520
a computer, a watch,
and a Jamón lbérico ham,

233
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,081
valued at... What?
$6,000.

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,846
$6,000 for a ham?

235
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:22,944
Jamón lbérico is an amazing
cured ham from Spain.

236
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:25,010
They had it at
my uncle's funeral.

237
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,842
I gorged myself at that funeral.

238
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:28,513
I mean, I was constipated
for three days.

239
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:30,765
Wow. That's a great
story, Charles. Thank you.

240
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,388
All right, listen up, everybody.

241
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,279
Better contact Captain Holt and let
him know we got a ten-tie situation.

242
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,863
Speaking of ties,
where's yours, Meep-Morp?

243
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:39,421
This is fantastic.

244
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,085
Captain! Hey!

245
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:42,318
Welcome to the murder.

246
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,415
What are you doing here?

247
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,046
I like to know what my
detectives are up to.

248
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:46,451
Is that okay by you?
Yep.

249
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,313
Take Santiago
and knock on doors.

250
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,541
See if the neighbors
heard anything.

251
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:50,978
Door duty?
It's a waste of time.

252
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,909
Diaz and Boyle, check in with the coroner.
Report back to me in an hour.

253
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,031
That went well.

254
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,434
No, it didn't.

255
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,526
He's got like, super hearing.

256
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,892
Hey, Rosa. Rosa, Rosa.

257
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:04,232
Um...

258
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,656
I just happened to notice that

259
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,918
there's an old movie festival

260
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,977
playing at the
Film Forum this week.

261
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,378
You want to go?

262
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,685
Sure.

263
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:15,983
Cool! Awesome.

264
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,906
There's a bunch
of movie options.

265
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:20,770
I'll probably just go
with something classic.

266
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:22,166
Like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

267
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,329
<i>Citizen Kane</i> is terrible.

268
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,733
Pick a good movie.

269
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,324
Good call. Smart.

270
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,423
I'll do it. I'll pick
a better movie than

271
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,585
<i>Citizen Kane.</i>

272
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
So, Gina, civilian
administrators like yourself

273
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,619
often have their ear
to the ground.

274
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,399
What do Santiago and Peralta have
riding on this bet of theirs?

275
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,303
I will tell you
on six conditions.

276
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,736
Number one, you let me use your
office to practice my dance moves.

277
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,821
Second... How about this.
If you tell me...

278
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:51,423
Mmm-hmm? ...I won't
have you suspended

279
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,693
without pay.
Oh, that sounds great!

280
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:58,791
Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more
arrests, Jake has to give her his car.

281
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,215
It's an old Mustang.
It's pretty sweet.

282
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:05,375
If he gets more arrests, she
has to go on a date with him.

283
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,007
He guarantees

284
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,237
it will end in sex.

285
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:12,467
I'd bet on at least some
over-the-clothes action.

286
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,868
At the very least some touching.

287
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,338
Oh, that's enough, Gina.
Caresses...

288
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,266
I could see him showing
up in a silk robe...

289
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,491
That's enough, Gina.

290
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,860
All right.
Thank you.

291
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,392
Let the wasting of time begin.

292
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,246
Hello, sir.

293
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:27,717
May we ask you a few questions?

294
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:28,876
Definitely. Yeah.

295
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:31,412
I'm actually... I'm super glad
you guys are here right now.

296
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,843
Are you smelling
that weed smell?

297
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:33,935
Yeah.
Yeah.

298
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:37,734
'Cause a dude broke in, smoked
weed, and bolted. It's...

299
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:41,765
Do you think it's the same dude that
left that bong there on the floor?

300
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,233
Yes.

301
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:46,155
Police.

302
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,052
Hello. What's your name?
Hello.

303
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,977
My name? Mlepnos.
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,909
Can you spell that, please?

305
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:58,638
M-L-E-P...

306
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,741
Clay.
Did you say Clay?

307
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,168
Yes. The "Clay" is silent.

308
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,637
All right. Got it.

309
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:04,965
Have you seen this man before?

310
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,467
He was shot last night.

311
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Oh!

312
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,364
Thank you.

313
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,826
No. Sir? That's ours.
We need that.

314
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,222
We...
And he kept it.

315
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,782
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> on the
doormat, top floor apartment.

316
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,882
20 bucks says this guy's like
a hot, eligible bachelor.

317
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:22,039
I'll take that action.
Police, open up.

318
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,233
Hello.

319
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,506
Hello, sir!
How are you today?

320
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,366
I am Detective
Right-All-The-Time,

321
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:33,529
and this is my partner,
Detective Terrible-Detective.

322
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,321
No surprises from the coroner.

323
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:38,982
Two gunshots,
shoulder and chest.

324
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,783
None of the neighbors
heard or saw anything.

325
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:44,114
And what's worse, Santiago
struck out with a 92-year-old.

326
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:45,713
That is not accurate, sir.

327
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,474
Wait, you hooked up
with him? Ugh!

328
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,340
All right. Hit the pawnshops
and canvas the neighborhood.

329
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:50,773
And while you're out,
you can buy yourself a tie.

330
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:52,171
Oh, actually, sir...

331
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,268
I'm wearing a tie right now.

332
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,339
Check it out!

333
00:12:56,436 --> 00:12:57,559
Secret tie!

334
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,354
First of all, I think you're kind of
overdoing it with the manscaping.

335
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,521
But more importantly, Detective,

336
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:04,184
why do you refuse
to take my orders seriously?

337
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,214
Does anyone here know why
it's so important to me

338
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,980
that you all dress
appropriately?

339
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:13,376
Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not
one of you can solve this simple mystery.

340
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:16,303
Okay, I want to be briefed
on any new developments.

341
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,634
Any questions? I was gonna ask you
if you thought I was doing too much

342
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,498
manscaping, but we solved that
one, so I'm good. Mmm-hmm.

343
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,391
Hey, Boyle.
Yeah?

344
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,487
What about this fancy ham stuff?
Jamón lbérico?

345
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,288
Yes. The perp left
a really expensive TV,

346
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:29,586
but then stole ham?
It doesn't make sense.

347
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,377
Is there a place nearby the
crime scene that sells it?

348
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,248
Beneficio's might.
Let's go.

349
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:36,275
You're gonna brief the CO first.

350
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,335
We'll brief him after
we catch the guy.

351
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,368
My name is Ratko.

352
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,837
I don't know anything.
Oh.

353
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,994
Okay. You recognize
this guy?

354
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,194
Henry Morgenthau?

355
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,269
No.

356
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:50,765
Maybe, actually...

357
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,885
Look at the picture?
I don't know him.

358
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:54,385
I don't know what happened.

359
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,459
No more questions!

360
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:57,444
Well, why don't I run
a scenario past you, Ratko,

361
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:58,749
and you tell me what you think?

362
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,112
You do know Morgenthau. He came in
here and tried to sell you some hams.

363
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,408
You knew they were worth
a lot of money,

364
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,138
so you tried to steal them
from him when he wasn't home.

365
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:05,937
Only he was home,
so you shot him.

366
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:07,962
Does that sound familiar?

367
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:10,035
Uh, maybe some role-play
will jog your memory?

368
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:11,896
That's a great idea.
Okay. Yeah.

369
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,966
Uh, so I'm... I'm Ratko.
No, no. I'm Ratko.

370
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,155
Come on. I'm always the victim.
So...

371
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,694
Look, I'm not doing this
with you right here.

372
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,953
Fine. Fine.

373
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:22,886
Oh, I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner
of delicious and expensive hams.

374
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:25,641
Don't I know you from the
grocery store? Kill.

375
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:26,917
And scene.

376
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,367
NYPD. Everyone, down!

377
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:32,700
Ma'am, if you could
just get down.

378
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,931
Or ignore me
and continue shopping.

379
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,901
- Boyle, get the door!
- On it.

380
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,494
Ratko?

381
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:43,753
Back up.

382
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:56,445
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

383
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,030
Ow! Ratko!
I'm getting mad!

384
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,864
That's a waste of Manchego!

385
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:00,972
Charles!

386
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:05,991
How are you still here?

387
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,188
Jake! Little help?

388
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:08,783
Ratko!

389
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,100
We're not going anywhere, Jake.

390
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:11,413
Ratko!

391
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,885
I've got him. It's cool.
I got him.

392
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:14,421
He's all mine.

393
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,276
<i>So, no, I did not brief you.</i>

394
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,307
And, yes, he did get away.

395
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:23,139
But, some bonus good news.

396
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,661
I got you hazelnut.

397
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:30,720
And, little spoon there,
for you.

398
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:37,480
Is he seriously assigning
me to the records room?

399
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,019
I mean, why do we even
have a records room?

400
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:40,811
The computer has been invented, right?
I didn't dream it?

401
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,343
You're lucky, man.

402
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,708
I wish I could get
assigned here full time.

403
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:47,531
You could not be farther
from the action.

404
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,366
Sergeant, you know me.

405
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,967
I have more arrests than anyone.

406
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,400
Will you please tell the
Captain how dumb it is

407
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,330
to lock his best detective
in a file cabinet?

408
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,454
Second best.

409
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:56,531
You're wrong about Holt.

410
00:15:56,597 --> 00:16:00,047
That man has forgotten more about
being a cop than you will ever know.

411
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,048
In 1981, he caught
the Disco Strangler.

412
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:07,106
It's over, Disco Man.

413
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,538
Put down the yo-yo and
back away from the girl.

414
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,133
Wow.
The man is the real deal.

415
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,361
You need to listen to him.

416
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:20,129
Going to be hard to win our bet
when you're on the bench, Peralta.

417
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,890
Although, I did start
a new category.

418
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,255
"Murderers we let go."

419
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,053
And look at that!

420
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,246
You're winning!

421
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,576
Have fun with your files.

422
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,444
Yeah. You know what? I will
have fun with my files.

423
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:33,980
Have fun with your face!

424
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:37,802
Slam!

425
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,398
That was a slam.

426
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,469
So? What movie did you
get us tickets to?

427
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,493
Oh, well, just to be safe,

428
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,153
I bought tickets to all of them.

429
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:50,382
Just to be safe?
What does that mean?

430
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,978
I don't know. Uh, I
didn't wanna mess up,

431
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,575
because you're
sort of opinionated.

432
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,014
You think I'm opinionated?

433
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,377
Okay, here's an opinion for you.

434
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:01,569
You're a bad judge of character
and your shirt looks like vomit.

435
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:03,863
So we can go see
<i>North by Northwest.</i>

436
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:04,997
We are not seeing
a movie together.

437
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:06,434
Good call. Smart.

438
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:08,134
Keep it profesh.

439
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,434
Hey, Captain.
So, you found something?

440
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,116
Hey, I like the tie.

441
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,774
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

442
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,486
Anyway, I think I got
something good here.

443
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:28,405
Turns out the name
Ratko is made up.

444
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,995
But I was digging
through these files,

445
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:32,434
one of which I literally
found in a spider web,

446
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:35,144
and it turns out there were a bunch
of references to a Serbian thug.

447
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,459
Street names, "The Rat"
and "The Butcher."

448
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,492
He was known to hang out at a
storage unit near Boerum Park,

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,885
which has red soil, hence,

450
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,916
the muddy red footprint
on Morgenthau's counter.

451
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:48,742
That's fine work, Detective.

452
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,744
Thank you very much, sir.

453
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:54,205
A testament to what can be achieved
when you dress appropriately.

454
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,228
Let's pound it out.

455
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,386
You know what?
Such fine police work.

456
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,249
Let's share it
with the whole team.

457
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,513
Santiago, Boyle,
Diaz, get in here.

458
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:09,550
Bring everyone.
And a camera.

459
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,844
That's not necessary.

460
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,883
Let's have a hand for the work
of the fine... Oh, they're here!

461
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,879
...master detective,
Jake Peralta.

462
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,202
Yeah. Let's have a hand,
everyone. Give him a hand.

463
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,501
Yeah, nice!

464
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:22,664
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Looking good!

465
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,798
No record of Ratko
on the ledger.

466
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,195
Must have used cash.

467
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,694
Well, I for one am just pumped to
be on a stakeout with you, Captain.

468
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,516
You know what my favorite
thing about stakeouts is?

469
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,610
Patrol Guide says no dress code.

470
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,847
So I'm just
the zip-up hoodie

471
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,481
and my two best friends.

472
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,036
Does he always talk this much?

473
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:41,169
I just tune it out.

474
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,574
It's like a white noise machine.

475
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,607
Okay, first of all,
that's racist.

476
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,032
Secondly...

477
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,693
Captain, Terry told me you
caught the Disco Strangler?

478
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,442
I mean, that's incredible.

479
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,624
I've read that case.

480
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:52,754
With all due respect, sir,

481
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,486
why'd it take you so long
to get your first command?

482
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,650
Because I'm gay.

483
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,012
Uh...

484
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,719
Seriously?

485
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,405
I'm surprised you didn't know.

486
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,776
I don't try to hide it.

487
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:14,696
Did anyone else get
a little bit of a gay vibe?

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,588
Manscaping.

489
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,127
Damn.

490
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,617
I am not a good detective.

491
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,111
Here. I feel bad

492
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:27,809
that you spent all that
money on the movie tickets.

493
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,278
Why don't you just go to
the movies with me? No.

494
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,502
Okay.

495
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,269
Well, this is awkward.

496
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,133
It's not awkward.

497
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,167
I like your company.

498
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,591
You're sweet.

499
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,182
When did you come out?

500
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,448
About 25 years ago.

501
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,947
The NYPD was not ready
for an openly gay detective.

502
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,072
But then the old guard died out,

503
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,840
and suddenly, they couldn't
wait to show off the fact

504
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,138
that they had a highly
ranking gay officer.

505
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,764
I made Captain,

506
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:02,235
but they put me
in a public affairs unit.

507
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:03,494
I was a good soldier.

508
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,829
I helped recruitment.

509
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,188
But all I ever really wanted
was my own command.

510
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:10,991
And now, I finally got it.

511
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:13,982
And I'm not gonna screw it up.

512
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:17,115
Uh, Captain, I'm sorry. I...

513
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,580
I feel like a jackass.

514
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:24,973
But, on the flipside,
there's Ratko.

515
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,895
Humility over.
I'm amazing.

516
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,689
Fantastic.
3,000 identical blue doors.

517
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,781
Looks like we all got door duty.

518
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:39,812
Oh, yeah.
From before.

519
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,476
Good one.

520
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,444
You look great.

521
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,636
Clear.

522
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:52,761
Clear.

523
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:05,420
Okay.

524
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,083
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable!

525
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,525
Ratko, great to see you.

526
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,756
You can't stop me.

527
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,686
I'm going.
Actually...

528
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:29,115
You're not going anywhere.

529
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,844
'Cause if you take a look to your left
you'll see Detectives Boyle and Diaz.

530
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,676
Right there
is Detective Santiago.

531
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,570
And behind you is Captain Holt.

532
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,834
Point is, my team
has you surrounded.

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,427
Oh, my God! I just
got the tie thing!

534
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,229
Captain, I just figured it out.

535
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,487
Maybe now's not
the best time, Detective.

536
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,823
It's a uniform.

537
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:52,986
We're a team, and the tie is a part
of that team's uniform, right?

538
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:54,249
You ask Ratko what team?

539
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:55,446
No, Ratko, shut up.

540
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,848
It's important to you, because you
were kept off the team for so long,

541
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,382
and now you're the coach

542
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,969
and you want us to all
wear that same uniform.

543
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,508
Boom! Nailed it.

544
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:06,335
Yes, you did.
Now, just arrest Ratko.

545
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,371
All right, Ratko, down.
Drop the weapon.

546
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,492
Hands on your head.
Here we go.

547
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,566
He's running!
Go!

548
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:14,864
Got him.

549
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,483
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back!

550
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,717
Stay down.

551
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:20,781
That's how we do
it in the Nine-Nine, sir.

552
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:23,181
We catch bad guys,
and look good doing it.

553
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:25,838
What's wrong with you?

554
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:27,877
Never took off the Speedo.
Big mistake.

555
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:29,307
It is inside me.

556
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:31,838
Great work, team!
