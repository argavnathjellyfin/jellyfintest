Okay, squad,
the funeral's at 3:00,

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,752
followed by a reception
at Shaw's Bar.

3
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:07,919
I want you all
on your best behavior.

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,155
Yeah, and all eyes
are gonna be on us

5
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,922
because Frick and Frack here
killed Captain Dozerman.

6
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,992
Hey, we accidentally
startled a man

7
00:00:12,993 --> 00:00:14,761
with a genetic heart condition.

8
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,842
If you really think about it,
his parents killed him.

9
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:18,031
All right, whatever.

10
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:19,532
Look, there's a horse race
going off in Dubai.

11
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,067
I got serious money on it.

12
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:22,735
Dismissed.

13
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:25,771
Oh, yeah, we should all
check out that race.

14
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,140
God.

15
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,242
He is the worst captain
we've ever had.

16
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:31,244
He drew boobies
on my bulletproof vest.

17
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,813
He stared at me for 90 seconds
while he ate an entire peach.

18
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:34,881
He heard that I speak Spanish,

19
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,582
and he made me fire
his housekeeper.

20
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,583
She was Polish.

21
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:38,751
At least he doesn't practice

22
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:39,752
his crane kicks with you.

24
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,091

25
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:46,092
I didn't move.

26
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,093
Listen, guys.

27
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:48,294
Jake and I were talking
last night.

28
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:49,796
Pillow talk alert!
Set the scene.

29
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,397
- Spooning or face-to-face?
- Charles.

30
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:52,632
[whispering] Spooning.

31
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:54,267
Anyway, we came up with a plan.

32
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:57,303
Jake is going to befriend
the Vulture

33
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:58,738

34
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,739

35
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,807
I'm gonna bro down with him.

36
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:01,974
If everything goes
according to plan,

37
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:03,142
we should be beer pong
doubles partners

38
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,444
by the end of the week.

39
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:06,779
Now somebody get me
a puka shell necklace.

00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,443
I got a fridge
for my protein shakes.

180
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:31,844
<i>I got a kettlebell station.</i>

181
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,246
<i>I got a wolf
that I killed in Utah.</i>

182
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,414
I'm fairly certain that's a dog.

183
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,681
Yeah, it was dark.

184
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:37,950
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need you

185
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:39,352
to sign these...

186
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:41,887
Captain Holt, I didn't
realize you were here.

187
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,988
Sergeant Jeffords, hello.

188
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,290
Welcome back.

189
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,591
Hey, you know, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

190
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,727
Hugs are a form of inappropriate
workplace touching.

191
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,395
Trust me, I'm very familiar

192
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,163
with the sexual harassment
guidelines.

193
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,431
That'll be all.

194
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,500
Well, I won't take up
too much of your time.

195
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:57,536
Because the Nine-Nine
was Captain Dozerman's

196
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,038
last precinct,
you will be seated

197
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,373
at the front of the funeral.

198
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,141
I wanted to alert you
that there'll be press,

199
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,142
cameras...

200
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:04,276
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cameras?

201
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,610
<i>Crap, nobody said anything
about cameras.</i>

202
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,112
I got to rock the bells.

203
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,383
There we go.

204
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,950
Oh, I noticed in the bullpen
that you had changed

205
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,219
the case numbering system.

206
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,552
I found, when I was
commanding officer, that...

207
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:16,222
I'm gonna stop you right there.

208
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:17,823
You're not commanding officer
anymore.

209
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,058
I was making a suggestion.

210
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,593
Yeah, look, you did a lot
of good for this place

211
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,194
while you were here,
which is great for me,

212
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,529
because I get
to take credit for it.

213
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,030
But you're not a real cop
anymore.

214
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,232
You're a desk jockey.

215
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,799
This is my precinct now.

216
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,737
And the sooner that you
accept that, the better.

217
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:35,474
Yes, well, I know my way out.

218
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,909
'Cause you used to work here.

219
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,844
I keep forgetting.

220
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,011
Everybody does.

221
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:45,618
Well, well, if it isn't
Captain Raymond Jacob Holt.

222
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,319
It's great to see you
back at the Nine-Nine, sir.

223
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,521
Yes.

224
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,356
There it is,
that classic Jake Holt banter,

225
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,690
zingers just flying around.

226
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,691
It's like you never left.

227
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,893
No, I most definitely left.

228
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,262
Okay.

229
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:58,564
Well, I know how much
you love hot goss,

230
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,466
so you probably heard
Amy and I have been dating.

231
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,034
And we would love your approval.

232
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,135
No.

233
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,170
But that's not
what this is about.

234
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,237
It sure is not.

235
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,772
Sir, the Vulture
is out of control.

236
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,107
All right, he told me
if I don't dump Amy,

237
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,175
he's gonna demote me.

238
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,309
You got to help us.

239
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,410
Let me stop you
right there, Peralta.

240
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,445
I'm not the Chief of Detectives.

241
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:13,846
I'm not the Vulture's boss.

242
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,747
I'm just some guy in PR.

243
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,616
- But we thought...
- I can't save your ass.

244
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:18,851
I don't work here anymore.

245
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:21,287
And the sooner you accept that,

246
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:22,554
the better.

247
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,194
Well, looks like somebody's
got a bad case

248
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,828
of the funeral crankies.

249
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,036
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

250
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,138
I know Captain Dozerman
was a nightmare

251
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,741
and that none of us liked him.

252
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:39,243
But I'm gonna need all of you
to pretend like you're sad.

253
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,144
Everyone make a sad face.

254
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,080
Scully, you are nailing it!

255
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:45,149
My wife just texted.
She's leaving me.

256
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,417
Good, use it.

257
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,718
Now, anyone seen Captain Holt?

258
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,420
He seemed a little down
when he came in.

259
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,855
Yeah, he let me choose the music

260
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,757
on the way over here,
which leads me to believe

261
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:53,991
he's given up on life.

262
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:55,226
<i>I got to go find him.</i>

263
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:58,096
Now, be respectful
and grieve your asses off.

264
00:07:58,097 --> 00:07:59,764
I don't know
why this is happening.

265
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:00,798
Scully, I love it!

266
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,032
Everyone follow his lead.

267
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,304
So what are we gonna do
about the Vulture?

268
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,239
I've got a new plan.
Pretend like we're talking.

269
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
- We are talking.
- Exactly.

270
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,441
It's working already.

271
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,576
Now I'm going to coolly

272
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,177
run my hands through my hair.

273
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:14,479
Look where my elbow's pointing.

274
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,746
[gasps] It's Davis Garmin,

275
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,081
Chief of Detectives.

276
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,448
Holt said he could
overrule the Vulture.

277
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:19,717
Exactly.

278
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:21,478
The only question now is,
will he believe us?

279
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,254
Yes, 'cause we're gonna
take a page

280
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,521
from the Vulture's book.

281
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,157
- "The Big Book of Small Butts"?
- What?

282
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:27,525
It's the only thing
I've ever seen him read.

283
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,560
No, we're gonna secretly
record the Vulture

284
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,962
telling you to dump me.

285
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:32,463
Then we'll play it
for Chief Garmin.

286
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:33,464
Then...

287
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:34,465
We're gonna totally

288
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,199
have sex on top of each other.

289
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,601
You get to keep your job.

290
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:38,802
Yes, that.

291
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:43,474
Ooh, Charles,
your jump-off is here.

292
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,608
Hello, Detective.

293
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,909
Hello, Lieutenant.

294
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:47,577
Real tragic about the captain.

295
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,279
Yes, real tragic.

296
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,881
I like the way
your butt looks today.

297
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,449
I've been doing lunges
in the shower.

298
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,152
Well, this got upsetting
real quick.

299
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,920
I want to live
in this moment forever.

300
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,956
I got us a motel room
across the street.

301
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:02,093
Meet me there in 15 minutes.

302
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,695
I'll meet you, all right.

303
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,529
M-E-A-T.

304
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,568
Still think it's creepy?

305
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:11,936
Yes.

306
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,871
Charles, it is not like you
to have sex

307
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,173
with a total stranger.

308
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:16,874
Really, tell that to me
in an hour

309
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,843
when we've had sex 23 times.

310
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,248
There you are.

311
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:25,249
You okay, sir?

312
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,718
No.

313
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,786
Until this morning,
some small part of me

314
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,289
still believed I would be
captain of the Nine-Nine again.

315
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,957
What a fool I was.

316
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,358
I should never have returned.

317
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:36,260
It's like visiting
your childhood home

318
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:39,796
and seeing it's been replaced
by a denim pants store.

319
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,535
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

320
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,605
Slow down, sir.

321
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,840
You didn't even stop
and sniff the bouquet.

322
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,508
You always sniff the bouquet.

323
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:52,677
Maybe the old Holt did.

324
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,278
But the new Holt
chugs Beaujolais

325
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,548
from a Burgundy glass
without a care.

326
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,717
Oh, it's a Sauternes glass.

327
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:03,487
Look, the alcohol has
rendered me a simpleton.

328
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:05,556
Maybe you should just
call it a day.

329
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:06,991
I can't.

330
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:09,727
I've been asked to deliver
a toast here after the funeral,

331
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:12,797
a message of hope.

332
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:14,398
This is what I have so far.

333
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:22,039
"Pain..."

334
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:26,044
That's it.

335
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,445
One tweak...

336
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:29,714
maybe you should lose
the word "pain"

337
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:31,582
and then get in a cab
and go home.

338
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,217
Maybe I will.

339
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:37,021
But first, you're gonna have
one drink with me, Sergeant.

340
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,356
For old times' sake?

341
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,258
- One drink, and then we go.
- One drink.

342
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,662
<i>♪ Sisters are doin' it
for themselves ♪</i>

343
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:48,766
My tolerance has really
changed since I had kids!

344
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,967

345
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,310
Hey, Captain.

346
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,112
I was looking for you inside.

347
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:03,281
One thing I won't do
is fart in church.

348
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:04,949
This is God's house.

349
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,784
Oh.

350
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:08,386
Respectful.

351
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:09,987
So listen, remember
when you said to me

352
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:12,290
that I have to dump Santiago

353
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,558
or else you're gonna bust me
down to beat cop?

354
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:16,994
What I remember, Jake,
is you pretending to be my bro

00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,030
and me being like,
"I'm onto you, dillweed.

356
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:22,466
[bagpipes blaring]

357
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,603
Oh, uh, sorry, could you
say that one more time?

358
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:27,137
I couldn't hear you
over the bagpipes.

359
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,773
[bagpipes blaring]

360
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:30,842
Ugh, one second.

361
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:32,276
Excuse me, could you stop
playing that?

362
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,643
Just trying to have
a conversation.

363
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,445
I'm warming up, man.
Sorry.

364
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,646
Yeah, I know.
We just need two minutes.

365
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,015
No can do.

366
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,817
The funeral's about to start.

367
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,418
Everyone wants
to hear me honk, so...

368
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:42,854
Do you really need
to warm up, though?

369
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,821
I mean, you're just gonna make
a terrible wall of sound.

370
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,823
First of all, that's offensive
to me as half Scottish.

371
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:50,728
Second of all, you think
you could do better?

372
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:51,996
Blow my bag.

373
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,631
Look, we just need
a couple of minutes to chat.

374
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,932
That's it.

375
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,400
I'm not gonna stop playing
until you blow it.

376
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:57,435
All right, just give it to me.

377
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,103
All right?

378
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:00,770
Prepare to hear me play
the bagpipes perfectly.

379
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,305
Okay.

380
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,509
[bagpipes wailing]

381
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,510
Oh, my God.

382
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,777
Point proven.

383
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,012
Yeah, I think I've heard
just about enough

384
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,013
of this catfight.

385
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,014
I'm out.

386
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,517
Wait, Captain! Sir!

387
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:16,119
Your boyfriend... sorry,
your ex-boyfriend is pathetic.

388
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,023
You should be glad
that I ordered him to dump you.

389
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,991
Swish, Kobe.

390
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,530
Got it.

391
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:28,232
Yes! You're amazing!

392
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:33,070
[bagpipes wailing]

393
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,371
That was "We Are the Champions."

394
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:38,195
Ugh, it's impossible
to find Garmin

395
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,330
with everybody mourning
all over the place.

396
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,566
It's like they have no respect
for our sneaky plans.

397
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,767
I know.

398
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,468
Oh, look, there he is.

399
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:46,570
Oh, great.

400
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:47,771
Hi there.

401
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:49,239
Sorry, this area is reserved

402
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,974
for close personal friends
of the deceased.

403
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,509
Ah, well, that is us.

404
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,311
Dozerman and I were
pretty much besties.

405
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:55,946
Went on an annual
fishing trip together.

406
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,814
Cayuga Lake,
caught a lot of Coho salmon.

407
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,483
We are both so bummed
that he's dead.

408
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:01,985
Super bummed.

409
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:04,187
Oh, right on.
Come in.

410
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:05,221
Thanks.

411
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,157
Blessings to you.

412
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,258
- Blessings?
- I don't know.

413
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,626
It's my first time in a church.

414
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:10,660
All right, how did you do that?

415
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:12,094
Simple detective work.

416
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,897
<i>There was a floral arrangement
up front with a picture</i>

417
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:16,099
<i>of Dozerman and 30 of his
friends holding a big fish.</i>

418
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,133
<i>Cayuga Lake, I pulled
straight from the guest book.</i>

419
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,468
<i>And Coho salmon?</i>

420
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:20,637
<i>Well, that's just something
I know about</i>

421
00:13:20,638 --> 00:13:21,805
<i>from being a man of the world.</i>

422
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,773
Our special today
is Coho salmon on a...

423
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:24,774
Sounds disgusting.

424
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,384
Do you have chicken fingers?

425
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,777
- Impressed?
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:29,412
And horrified
by your eating habits.

427
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:30,513
Well, if I'm so unhealthy,

428
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:32,816
how come I never
go to the bathroom?

429
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:36,119
- Okay, let's get to Garmin.
- Yeah.

430
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,288
Hi, I'm Margaret Dozerman.

431
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,856
How did you know my husband?

432
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:42,692
Oh, Mrs. Dozerman,
your husband was a great man.

433
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,628
Some of my fondest
memories of him

434
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:45,996
were on our fishing trips.

435
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,097
You went on those trips?

436
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,098
I did, indeed.

437
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,634
They called me "the Coho King."

438
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,769
Pretty much single-handedly
organized those things myself.

439
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,406
So you were the one
who brought all the prostitutes?

440
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:59,309
Uh...

441
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,278
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we slow down?</i>

442
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,879
Why?
Are you not into this?

443
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,147
No, no, no.

444
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:06,349
My friends are just in my head.

445
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,617
They think it's weird

446
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,486
that we don't know anything
about each other.

447
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:11,054
I think it's hot.

448
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:13,323
Totally, I'm glad we're
not interested in each other

449
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:16,026
as human beings.

450
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:19,429
Oh, how about if you
tell me things about yourself

451
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,865
and then I tell you how little
I care about them?

452
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,800
Okay.

453
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,035
Okay, here goes.

454
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,607
I'm an only child.

455
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:28,542
- Not interested.
- I was born in Delaware.

456
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,609
Who even asked you?

457
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,111
I like this.

458
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:33,013
I don't care what you like.

459
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,817
But maybe you could tell me
one more thing.

460
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,654
She's a vegan!

461
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,221
What is going on?

462
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,057
You're right.
I couldn't help myself.

463
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,225
I wanted to know about her.

464
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,826
And I got what I deserved...

465
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:49,263
a vegan, a gluten-free vegan!

466
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,399
Charles, you need to calm down.

467
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,034
<i>No.
You called it, Rosa.</i>

468
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,869
So go ahead.
Laugh at me!

469
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,903
Laugh!

470
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:56,970
Laugh it up!

471
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:58,905
Can I wait till after
the funeral?

472
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,975
Shh!

473
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,009
Of course you can.

474
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:06,846
<i>Sir, my life stinks.</i>

475
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,783
Sharon's on bed rest.

476
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:12,118
My favorite mango yogurt
got discontinued.

477
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,989
And my kids think
their preschool teacher's

478
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,024
a stupidface.

479
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,928
Everyone I work with
is a stupidface.

480
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,529
Especially Bryce.

481
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:23,898
- Sir?
- Hmm?

482
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:24,899
- Sir?
- Hmm?

483
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,032
- Sir?
- Hmm?

484
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,902
Can I be honest?

485
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:29,737
Precinct's not the same
without you.

486
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,772
The Vulture's the worst.

487
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,440
My mango yogurt...

488
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,708
Yes, you already mentioned
the yogurt.

489
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,277
'Cause it's important!

490
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,646
When I saw you
in the office this morning,

491
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,982
I wanted to give you
the biggest hug.

492
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:43,751
But the Vulture told you not to,

493
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:44,852
and you had to listen.

494
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,286
He's your captain now, Terry.

495
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,357
I hate going to work
and you're not there.

496
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,725
Everything is garbage.

497
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,129
Hmm.
"Everything is garbage."

498
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,798
I should put that in
my message of hope.

499
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,899
That's a really good idea!

500
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:02,737
It took my husband and me
years of counseling

501
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,704
to get over those little
backwood orgies of yours.

502
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,906
He had sex with five prostitutes
in one weekend.

503
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,476
- Ugh!
- That's bananas!

504
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,610
I had no idea.

505
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:10,778
I was probably too busy praying.

506
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,279
You said you planned the trips.

507
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:15,349
- Yeah, I did say that.
- Called yourself the Coho King.

508
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,484
All right, look.

509
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,151
I'm not the Coho King.

510
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,253
My name is Jake.

511
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,688
And your husband
was only my captain

512
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,689
for, like, a day.

513
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,790
Wait a second.

514
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,625
Are you the Jake
that killed him?

515
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,663
No, I'm prostitute Jake.

516
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:29,829
I love prostitutes.

517
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:30,865
You need to go.

518
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,999
<i>You should leave right now.</i>

519
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,067
You need to leave right now.

520
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,502
It's okay, Margaret.
Come on.

521
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,537
Oh, Chief Garmin,
wait, I just...

522
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,772
need to play you one
quick recording of my boss.

523
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,942
You recorded me?

524
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,244
That's not cool, Jake.

525
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:45,179
Well, we were just taking
a page out of your book.

526
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,614
Yeah? What are you
gonna do next, huh?

527
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,281
Are you gonna start wearing
leather bracelets, hmm?

528
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,916
Good luck pulling off
that chunky-B

529
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,686
with those skinny little
girl wrists of yours.

530
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:52,687
Congratulations.

531
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,388
You're no longer a detective.

532
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,190
You're a beat cop again.

533
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,626
I just crushed your dreams.

534
00:16:58,627 --> 00:16:59,626
[clicks tongue]

535
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:04,865
Okay, I know things
seem really bad right now,

536
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:06,399
but we just need a minute
to think.

537
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:09,269
[bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace"]

538
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,303
Come on, man!

539
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,301
Okay, so the Vulture
has your phone.

540
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,902
But new plan...

541
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,271
Jake, we've had lots of plans,

542
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,505
and none of them have worked.

543
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,007
Yeah, but this is a good one.

544
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,042
The new plan is: No plan.

545
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,277
We wing it!

546
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,344
Probably won't work,
but I said it

547
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,445
with a lot of confidence.

548
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,747
Jake, you got demoted.

549
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,448
We said this relationship
wasn't gonna get

550
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,250
in the way of our careers,
and it has.

551
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,052
So what?
We'll figure it out.

552
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
I'll make my way
back to detective.

553
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,189
Or maybe you won't.

554
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,257
I'm not gonna let you
throw away your dream job.

555
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,792
Amy, this is good.

556
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,994
This is a six-day relationship.

557
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,096
We don't know what it is.

558
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,998
And now for a message of hope.

559
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,034
Ah, a message of hope,
right on time.

560
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,969
Everything is garbage.

561
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,003
Oh, no.

562
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,438
You find something
you care about,

563
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,040
and it's taken from you...

564
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,507
your colleague,

565
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,144
your dream job,

566
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,145
your mango yogurt.

567
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,213
Whoo!

568
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:06,038
Never love anything.

569
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,127
<i>That's the lesson.</i>

570
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,462
To Captain Dozerman.

571
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:12,896
All: Captain Dozerman.

572
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,164
Thank you, sir.

573
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,233
I'll take it from here.
Very poetic.

574
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,303
If I might offer
a counter-toast of sorts.

575
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:21,372
<i>Captain Dozerman and I,</i>

576
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,507
we weren't together
for very long.

577
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,109
In fact, as coworkers,

578
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,312
our relationship
was only six days.

579
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,747
<i>But that's not nothing.</i>

580
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,181
It was long enough
for me to know

581
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,750
that we had something special.

582
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:34,952
<i>And sure,
there may be obstacles.</i>

583
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:38,355
Him having passed away,
for example.

584
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:40,291
<i>But I'm not giving up on us.</i>

585
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,359
And I don't care
if I get demoted.

586
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,164
I just care
about being with you...

587
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:50,067
Captain Dozerman,

588
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,769
an adult man

589
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,337
<i>who has passed
into the nether world.</i>

590
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,072
<i>Move over, Peralta!</i>

591
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:56,807
Move over!

592
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:57,841
Okay.

593
00:18:57,842 --> 00:19:00,944
And if I may do a third toast.

594
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:04,848
It'll be focused primarily
on the mango yogurt.

595
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,150
[all groan]

596
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:07,384
Don't boo me!

597
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:09,585
I lost something important
too, shoot.

598
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,892
Thought I might find you here.

599
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,261
So not a big fan
of my speech, huh?

600
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:19,196
No, I loved it.

601
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,598
I mean, I wish it hadn't
been at a wake.

602
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,900
And I wish you hadn't
kept referring to me

603
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:23,949
as your dead boss.

604
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,602
Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt

605
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:27,771
but still was somehow
the best of the three toasts.

606
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:28,772
Hmm.

607
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:30,074
Look, I don't want to break up.

608
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,542
But I don't want
to get demoted either.

609
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:33,476
I just don't know what to do.

610
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,812
I'm all out of plans.

611
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,680
I have one.

612
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,615
Holt saves your ass.

613
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:39,650
Captain.

614
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,018
I was moved
by your speech, Peralta.

615
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,519
Thank you, sir.
That's very nice of you to say.

616
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,388
- The syntax was problematic.
- Less nice.

617
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,056
And your vocabulary
is a true indictment

618
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:47,224
of the public school system.

619
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:48,559
Seems like you're just
slamming me now.

620
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,561
But the fact that you're
not willing to give up

621
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:52,863
in the face of adversity
is inspiring.

622
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,631
I love the Nine-Nine,

623
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,333
and I'm not gonna turn
my back on the squad.

624
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,035
So I fixed your problem
with the Vulture.

625
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,504
- Really?
- I may just be a guy in PR.

626
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:03,307
But what does the Vulture
love more than anything?

627
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:04,341
Garbage Pail Kids?

628
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,377
No. Publicity.

629
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,544
Captain Pembroke,
how would you like

630
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:09,313
your face on the NYPD website?

631
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,681
Really?

632
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,383
Yes!
Yes!

633
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:13,751
In exchange for media attention,

634
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:14,985
the Vulture will not
bust you down

635
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:16,687
or stand in the way
of you two dating.

636
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:18,422
Sir, I don't know
how to thank you.

637
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:20,891
Anything for the Nine-Nine.

638
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,626
Thank you, sir.

639
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,828
He totally approves of us.

640
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,297
Whatcha doing there, Boyle?

641
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:29,566
Trying to get drunk enough
to have sexual intercourse

642
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,968
with a vegan.

643
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,302
Why can't I just think
with my junk

644
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:33,370
like a modern man?

645
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,371
Why do you want to do that?

646
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:35,406
[sighs]

647
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,374
I got divorced,
and I was crushed.

648
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,610
My fiancée left.
I cried for weeks.

649
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,044
My only relationship that wasn't

650
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,613
totally devastating
when it ended

651
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,581
was my casual sex carnival
with Gina.

652
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:45,642
Yeah, okay,

653
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,017
But with of those relationships

654
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:49,086
made you happiest
before it ended?

655
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,052
[sighs]

656
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,604
My marriage.
Vivian.

657
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,857
Yeah, because you connect
with them emotionally,

658
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,626
something we did not do

659
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,461
because I'm a higher level
of being,

660
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:59,096
like Her from the movie "Her."

661
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:01,598
Dude, you can't go through
life trying not to get hurt.

662
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,000
You should try to be happy.

663
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:04,968
So you think I should
look for someone

664
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,603
I can have emotional
intercourse with.

665
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:08,605
I wish you hadn't said it
like that, but yeah.

666
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,307
And I should start
right here at this funeral.

667
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:11,308
I'd probably wait.

668
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,843
Nope, no time to lose.

669
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:14,111
Put on your sunglasses.

670
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:15,579
I need to see if there's
anything in my teeth.

671
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,913
Ugh.

672
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,785
Oh, yeah.

673
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:24,687
Charles Boyle is ready for love.

674
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:28,558
Well, never wearing these again.
