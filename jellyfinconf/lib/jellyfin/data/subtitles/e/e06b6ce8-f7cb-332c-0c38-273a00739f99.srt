00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,335
- Good morning, Boyle.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,105
It's Halloween--I'm surprised
you didn't put on a costume.

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,073
- I was going to, sir,
but then I decided,

4
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,408
"screw that jazz."

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,577
Well, I'm the only one
who ever dresses up,

6
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,345
no one ever gets
my costume,

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,280
and they make fun of me--
so I'm done.

8
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,083
These people don't deserve
my dress-up gifts.

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,354
No costume?

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,389
- What the hell, Charles?

13
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,790
Where's your
Halloween spirit?

14
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,192
- But you guys always
make fun of me.

15
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,596
- I have never once
insulted you in my life,

16
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:33,132
especially vis-à-vis
your appearance.

17
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,800
- Yeah, man, we always
love your costumes.

18
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,136
- Remember last year,
when you came as that

19
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,405
person and/or thing?

20
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,806
- Yes, I do remember!

21
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:44,076
Sir, permission to sprint
to my car and get

22
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,144
my emergency costume?

23
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,278
- Does it matter
if I say no?

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,080
- No!

25
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,254
A-bam, bam, boom.

26

What the--what--

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,625
- Why are you dressed up?
You look like an idiot.

28
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,060
- But--but--

29
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,294
- Yeah, what are you
supposed to be,

30
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,829
a sassy car mechanic?

31
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,199
- No, come on--he's clearly
the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot,

32
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,300
Harry Pop-Tart.

33
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,202
- I am not!
You know who I am!

34
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,104
- Squad, that's enough--
you're making Boyle

00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,623
He's Elvis.
- Yes!

37
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,140

- Attention, squad:
today is the most

41
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,433
important day in the
history of this precinct.

42
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,337
For today is Halloween--

43
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,139
I thought we were going to
say it together.

44
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,440
- I never agreed to that.
- All right.

45
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,641
- As you may know,
for the past two years,

46
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,212
Captain Holt and I have engaged
in an epic battle of wits.

47
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,614
The goal: to determine
who must call the other

48
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,649
an amazing
detective/genius.

49
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,452
- The first year,
by sheer, dumb luck,

50
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,354
Jake eked out a feeble victory.

51
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,889
- And last year, I let
the captain win,

52
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,491
because he's old and sad.

53
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,459
- Sad because the competition
was so dismal.

54
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,694
- Is this meeting
about something?

55
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,295
- It's about everything.

56
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,430
<i>- This year's the tie-breaker,</i>

57
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,365
a final heist to decide
once and for all

58
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,434
the true king of the nine-nine.

59
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,303
- Halloween Heist III:
The Heistening. Tagline?

60
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,272
- This year we both attempt
to steal the same object

61
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,241
instead of Jake attempting
to steal one from me.

62
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,643
- I gave you one direction
on the tagline--snappy.

63
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,546
But yes, we will be attempting
to steal the same item--

64
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,214
this.

65
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:30,682

66
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,539

so to be fair,
we're holding a draft.

71
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,363
The captain and I have
given up our overtime,

72
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,665
so everyone who participates
will get the night off--captain?

73
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,934
- With the first pick
of the draft, I choose...

74
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,469
Terry.

75
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,272
- Okay, brawns over brains.

76
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,473
- All right, I take Charles.

77
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,941
- I get it. Close friend.

78
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,276
- I pick Gina.
- Gina?

79
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,477
- I take Rosa.

80
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,478
- What?

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,947
Okay, all right.
Well, Captain--

82
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,582
that leaves me with you.

83
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,417
Let's do this.
- Hang on, Santiago.

84
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,718
I'm not sure I can
trust you.

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,390
You're Peralta's paramour;
maybe you should be on his team.

86
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,258
- No, no, no--
Amy would do anything

87
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,527
to win your approval,
including pretending

88
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,563
to be in a relationship with me
for the past few weeks

89
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,431
only to betray me now.

90
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,366
- Jake, you are majorly
overthinking this.

91
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,702
- Maybe, but it's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

92
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,272
You're not on my team, Amy.
- Yeah, Amy's out.

of the nine-nine.

to guard the briefcase too.

cheap, rubber mask.

to set you up with.

set me up with someone,

but I do not trust your taste
in guys at all.

Nadia's not a cool name?

You are impossible.

by leaving me off your team.

- Oh, I had no idea
you felt that way.

the camera is.

telling the truth,

00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,468
then I sincerely
apologize.

134

- Damn it.

343
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,276
That son of a bitch is good.

344
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,347
- We have to get
that crown back.

345
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,316
I already changed my email
to "kingjakerulez" with a z.

346
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,084
Everyone's going to think
I'm an idiot.

347
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,253
- Hello, Peralta.
- Captain.

348
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,888
- Midnight nears.
- Yes, it does.

349
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,091
Tick tock.
- Tick tock indeed.

350
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,527
- But tick tock for who?

351
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,829
- You know it's "for whom."

352
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,896
Don't try to provoke me.

353
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,332
- I didn't know that.

354
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,100
both: I'm going to get
that crown back.

355
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,101
- Wait--what?
- Huh?

356
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,404
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

357
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,539
- Yes, I too
need to be excused.

358
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,341
- [whispering]
He doesn't have the crown!

359
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,309
- What? Who has it, then?

360
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,211
- I don't know who has it.
- What do we do?

361
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,146
- Pull the security tape.
I'll distract them.

362
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,215
Hey, look at this.

363
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:14,385
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

364
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,120
Damn it, how did that
not work?

365
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,591
- Hmm, Captain Holt said
you guys stole the crown

366
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,226
when Jake came through
the ceiling.

367
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,627
- Yeah, I can't believe
you fell for that.

368
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,329
You really think I'd mark
the wrong vent?

369
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,364
I've never marked
a wrong vent in my life.

370
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,932
- You're very intense
about vents.

371
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,200
- Yeah.

372
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,869
- Wait--so Nadia wasn't
just a distraction?

373
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,171
- No, 100% real.

374
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,274
Handsome, cool, hair as thick
as a collie's.

375
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,443
I found you the perfect guy,
and you drove him off.

376
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,245
- Ugh. I'm sorry.

377
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,146
I should have trusted you.

378
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,182
Please call him
and tell him I messed up.

379
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,284
- Fine, but only if you
agree that your first date

380
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,286
will be a double date
with me and Genevieve

381
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,554
on a week-long trip
to Turk's--

382
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,356
- Forget it, no.
Forget it.

383
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,423
- No! Okay, I'll call him.

384
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,158
Please, I want this
so badly.

385
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,161
- Fine, you may
call him for me.

386
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,330
- Thank you.

387
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,666
- Okay, here I am taking
pictures with Terry's kids.

388
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,168
Man, I look so strong
standing next to them.

389
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,236
Should I have kids?
- Sure.

390
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,170
Okay.

391
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,606
It's Holt.
Whoa, how did he do that?

392
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,308
- Guy has an insane
set of abs.

393
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,443
Oh, look,
he's got the crown.

394
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,645
And he's headed to
the break room.

395
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,213
- He dumped it in the trash.

396
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,314
Did he go back and get it?

397
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,684
- Nope, janitor came in
and took it.

398
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,919
But which janitor?

399
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,453
Looks like I'm going to
have to squint.

400
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,559
His name is Al--
Al the janitor.

401
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,929
All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now;
That means Al's long gone.

402
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,463
How are we going to
get his home address?

403
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,365
- Who's the one person you know
who's anal enough

404
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,335
to send out holiday cards
to every single employee?

405
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,406
- Amy!
- What do you want, Jake?

406
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,975
- What? Why would you assume
that I want anything?

407
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,511
What I want is to apologize
to my girlfriend,

408
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,612
who I hurt.

409
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,680
- It's "whom."

410
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,281
- Why does the word "who"
even exist

411
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,449
if you're not allowed
to say it?

412
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,217
Anyways, now that
I've apologized

413
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,955
and you've accepted, can you
give me janitor Al's address?

414
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,223
- This is related
to your heist, isn't it?

415
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,960
- No, no.
It's about a crime.

416
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,662
I think janitor Al is
going to kill the president.

417
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,265
- Oh, Santiago.
There's my protégé.

418
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,334
- Let me guess--
you want the janitor's address.

419
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,370
- Janitor? Address? Al?

420
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,238
- I never said his name.

421
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,574
Well, isn't this rich.

422
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,977
After being excluded
by both of you,

423
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,378
here I am with the power
to decide

424
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,247
who wins and who loses
your little heist.

425
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,649
- I wouldn't have it
any other way.

426
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,651
You are my wisest detective.

427
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,988
- Pathetic.
She can't be manipulated, sir.

428
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,656
Amy, we are in love.

429
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,690
I know we've never
said it before,

430
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,759
but I think this is
the perfect time, don't you?

431
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,427
- Love? Ha.

432
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,530
What's love compared to the
respect of a workplace superior?

433
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,599
- Amy Santiago,
will you m--

434
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,368
- Enough!
- Okay.

435
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,403
- Pretending to be nice to me
is worse than being mean.

436
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,373
You know what?
You want the address?

437
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:52,543
Here, you can both have it.

438
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,412
[cell phones ringing]

439
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,581
Hope you're happy,
you selfish monsters.

440
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,684
- I feel terrible.
- We should apologize.

441
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,085
- Yes, I agree.

442
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,421
You definitely should now;
I'll do mine later.

443
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,023
- Fat chance.

444
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,624
- Charles, I need your butt.
Meet me downstairs.

445
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,393
- Alpha Team, this is
the Golden Sparrow.

446
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,794
Rendezvous at
Drop Zone Yankee.

447
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,763
- When did you come up
with those code names?

448
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,700
Okay, he lives on
the sixteenth floor.

449
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,601
- I think we beat Holt here.

450
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,337
- Or did you?
- I'll get the elevator.

451
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,672
- Crap! Looks like
we're taking the stairs.

452
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,577
All right, it's sixteen floors--
pace yourselves.

453
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,446
Forget it.
Run as fast as you can!

454
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,652
[panting]

455
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,822
[knocks]
Ha ha!

456
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,458
I win. I knocked first.

457
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:42,727
You're not Al.

458
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,328
- You're looking for Al?

459
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,464
- Of course we're looking
for Al, you imbecile!

460
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,699
Sorry.

461
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,601
- He's having a cigarette
on the roof.

462
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,836
- The roof?

463
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,375
[panting]

464
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,544
Yes.
I did it.

465
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,712
I am the greatest
athlete in the world.

466
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,614
[vomits]

467
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,483
- Al? Al?

468
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,718
Where's Al?

469
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,654
- Oh, there he is.
There he is!

470
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,689
I did it. I did it.

471
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,391
[vomits]

472
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,859
- Good God.

473
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,095
Are you Al the janitor?

474
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,465
- Nope.
I'm your worst nightmare.

475
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,533
Amy Santiago.

476
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,169
- Oh, no.

477
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,642
- I don't understand
what is happening.

478
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,744
- Allow me to explain.

479
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,181
Amy and I were ahead of you
the whole time.

480
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,317
- No, you weren't
part of this.

481
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,586
Get back over to
the loser side, loser.

482
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,587
- All right.
Worth a shot.

483
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,754
- So how'd you pull it off?

484
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,940
- Well, it all started
when I went to tell Jake

485
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:48,125
how badly he hurt
my feelings,

486
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,827
and he yelled at
my breasts.

487
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,296
- Oh, boy, I am not going to
come off well in this story.

488
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,331
- Nope.

489
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:55,733
Remember when you
set off the witch?

490
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,199
[witch cackling]

491
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,902
<i>You made Captain Holt</i>
<i>flinch, which was weird,</i>

492
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,403
<i>since his door was closed,</i>

493
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,739
<i>but not weird, since he</i>
<i>actually heard it over a bug</i>

494
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,241
<i>he planted at your desk.</i>

495
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,309
It was in an old muffin that you
never threw in the trash.

496
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,345
- That's why people
throw away garbage.

497
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,346
- How are we together?

498
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,680
- Eh.

499
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,749
- Anyway, I tapped into
the bug's frequencies,

500
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,618
so I had ears on Jake.

501
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,886
<i>I needed to know</i>
<i>what Holt was up to.</i>

502
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,888
That's where Hitchcock
came in.

503
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,890
- I masterminded
the entire plan.

504
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,359
- You did one small thing,
and I had to explain it to you,

505
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,760
like, 45 times.

506
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,629
<i>He left a tiny crack</i>
<i>in the blind,</i>

507
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,897
<i>so I could read</i>
<i>the Captain's lips.</i>

508
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,916
<i>"Sharon and your kids</i>
<i>will distract Jake.</i>

509
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,934
<i>"They'll be here at 9:30 sharp.</i>

510
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,770
<i>My waffle xylophone</i>
<i>on the cheese man."</i>

511
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,771
- What?

512
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,206
- My lip-reading
is not flawless.

513
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,407
<i>Now that I knew your plan,</i>

514
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,742
it was simple to disrupt.

515
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,677
<i>While Scully gracefully</i>
<i>moved the witch,</i>

516
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,212
<i>I got into character.</i>

517
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,246
<i>Holt triggered the witch,</i>

518
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,648
<i>which brought Jake</i>
<i>into the room.</i>

519
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,416
- And I threw the crown
in the trash can.

520
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,351
- Exactly as I planned.

521
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,655
Then I sent you all here,
placed an out-of-order sign

522
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,457
on the perfectly
functional elevator,

523
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,293
made you all walk up
31 flights of stairs

524
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,761
and vomit twice.

525
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,862
- Actually, it was four times,

526
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,264
if you count all
the stairwell stuff.

527
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,933
- You thought I was
just Holt's lackey.

528
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,402
And you thought I was
just Jake's girlfriend.

529
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,370
Well, I'm my own person,

530
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,472
capable of making
my own decisions,

531
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,741
and I decided to
humiliate you both.

532
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,879
- Well, you did,
and it was awesome.

533
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,949
One last question:
where's the crown?

534
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,717
- Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar,

535
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,420
the official site
of my coronation.

536
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,689
- All hail the crown of destiny.

537
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,725
[cheers]

538
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:32,496
And all hail she who wears it,
Amy Santiago, the...

539
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,265
- Queen.

540
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,967
- Queen of the nine-nine.

541
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,435
[cheers]

542
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,836
- I believe there's
something else

543
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,971
you both need to say.

544
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:40,972
<i>- Gladly.</i>

545
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,240
both:
Amy Santiago

546
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,376
is an amazing
detective/genius.

547
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,744
Drinks are on us.

548
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,746
- Nope.
- Drinks are on me.

549
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,314
- Yeah!

550
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,885
- Hey.

551
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,487
- I'm glad you showed up.

552
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,789
Sorry I was acting
so weird earlier.

553
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,826
- Hey, I don't blame you.
Sagittarius, right?

554
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,995
With Saturn where it is,
you're right to be wary

555
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,429
of new relationships.

556
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:09,333
- How is it possible
that a spirit such as yourself

557
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,735
even knows Charles?

558
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,536
- I did an art show
at Genevieve's gallery.

559
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,339
- Oh, right--so you're not
really friends,

560
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,042
you know his girlfriend
through the art world.

561
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,311
- Yeah, plus,
she's my twin sister.

562
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,479
- What?

563
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,481
- Hi, Leo.
A kiss for my bro.

564
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,016
And a kiss for my beau.

565
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,050
- No.

566
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,285
- A kiss for my beau.

567
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,953
And a kiss for my sis.

568
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,288
- No!
